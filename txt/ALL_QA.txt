Q: What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.

Courier makes it easy to add multiple channels for user notifications. Think of how Slack or Twitch intelligently route notifications to the right medium - if you're active in your browser it shows it via browser push, if you're idle it'll send it to mobile push, or it can always fall back on email. Courier also makes it easy to add emerging notification channels like notifying users within their own Slack organization, via your instance of Intercom, or over a messaging channel like WhatsApp. Finally Courier can further reduce engineering costs by delivering out-of-the-box UI kits for managing notification preferences and subscribing to content.

We’re making the world’s first VR Linux distro, runnable as a standalone OS on any Head-Mounted Display (HMD) or VR/AR-equipped computer. We’re doing this because we believe the following:

(T) Most people think that the future of VR is in games and entertainment, but it is also in office work; in particular, VR is going to replace screens and laptops.

Because of (T), the VR industry is too biased towards Windows (where PC games are traditionally deployed); moreover, nobody is thinking about how VR can be optimized for (i) clear text resolution and (ii) having multiple 2D and 3D apps simultaneously running in a shared workspace.

The product will work like this: simply plug in your headset, install our OS (or its window manager), and all of your existing 2D and 3D Linux applications will float in a shared work space (3D applications reside in either “cuboids” or “2D portals”, as shown in our demo). This will give users unlimited virtual screens (of any size), crystal clear text resolution (something the OS will be optimized for), and Linux. Initially, the OS will be able to run on any VR ready computer, but our ultimate goal is for manufacturers to be able run it as a standalone OS on their own HMDs (which increases our distribution upper bound; see below).

1. Value proposition for consumers: A distraction-free, highly immersive and unlimited VR workspace that is 10x better than using physical screens. Literally: users can have 10x as many screens as they currently do. Each of these screens is more than 10x cheaper (i.e., free) than any physical alternative. A VR headset is even 10x smaller than a multi-monitor setup, and can fit in a bag.

2. Value proposition for HMD manufacturers: A free and open-source VR OS they can modify and deploy on their headsets without having to pay Microsoft for any licensing fees.

Something analogous to (2) held for Android in the late 2000s. During this period, Apple was closed off to smartphone manufacturers, while Microsoft’s mobile platform had expensive licensing fees and closed-source barriers to the hardware. This created an opportunity for a Linux-based OS to take off – an OS which is now installed on over 1.5 billion devices. In this sense, Simula wants to be “Android for VR”.

Parsnip

Imagine learning another language by reading Harry Potter in French, Haruki Murakami in Japanese, or watching Breaking Bad in German.

My product, Parsnip, is an e-book reader (and later media player) with integrated definitions, conjugations and other references so you don’t need to jump back and forth looking things up. It also tracks the words you’ve seen or looked up and automatically creates and schedules review activities ensuring you don’t forget new words. You get the references you need, when you need them and the reviews ensure that you don’t forget what you’ve read.

This is much better than the alternatives like:
- sticking it in google translate and hoping it’s good enough or
- writing new words down in a notebook and hoping you can find it in a dictionary.

Then adding the words you found to a flashcard app which can’t tell that two cards both have the word ‘run’ on them.

To begin with Parsnip will target intermediate and above language learners. There is currently nothing targeted at them. Initially, Parsnip will use text based content and later expand to include audio, video, and comics.

We are making a platform where users in Brazil can compare, choose, and get an online payroll-deductible loans in under 20 minutes, rather than the typical 3–4 business days offline. Today, it’s a USD 80+ billion dollar market only in Brazil, representing 60% of all personal loans — and no online platforms are approaching it.

Payroll-deductible loans works like that: the employee presents a salary deduction form from a bank authorizing the employer to deduct a monthly sum from the employee’s salary and pay it over to the lender. So, the employer starts making the authorized deduction, the loan is repaid and everyone goes their merry way. It is very popular because it is the cheapest personal loan available in the country, up to 10 times cheaper than credit card and other personal loans.

Other characteristics of this loan are:
- 92% of the market is focused on people who have stable incomes, such as retired people and public servants, who acquire job stability after 3 years of employment;
- Users can get multiple loans, which can sum up to 35% of their monthly salary and pay it back in 96 months;
- There is no need for credit scoring. If the sum of one’s monthly instalments is less than 35% of his monthly salary, he is good to go.

It represents a HUGE market that grew 20% last year, while Brazil’s economy shrunk 1%. We are bringing speed, convenience and transparency to this market. It is impossible to overstress the importance of payroll-deductible loans in sustaining the level of consumption in Brazil. It need to be fixed. We are doing it.

Pic ur Photo

Pic ur Photo is a visual photographer booking platform. It’s a curation of the best photo locations, where we place photographers in 3-8 hour shifts that are split up and booked out for quick 30 minute minishoots.

The photography industry has barely adapted to the cell phone age. Professional photography is a difficult, expensive process that’s generally unattainable on a regular basis. 70% of social media users, LinkedIn Members, and business owners want better photos. That number continues to grow, but alternatives to the traditional model have failed to change materially from what existed 20 years ago.

Pic ur Photo users search for inspiration on the platform. They browse locations, styles, and moods for a look and book a photoshoot in the same location as their favorite photos. Our peeps (aka customers) only pay for the photos they want to keep, and shoots are so fun, people tell us they forget we’re even taking pictures.

Programming system that uses direct manipulation and visualisation of data.

You can filter and group data in the table.

You can process data using formulas by adding new cells to existing tables or even by creating new tables on the same canvas.

You can change the view of data from table to some chart or other custom visualiser at any step.

You bind UI elements and graphic objects to table cells to make user-facing interfaces / visualisations.

You bind “robots” to table cells to do output data, i.e. to send e-mail, to post data to some web service, etc.

You mark what elements on canvas should be published and app is generated from that.

I’d like to make a better tool for programmers (for certain types of projects) and make it easy to integrate with existing programming systems using simple API.

It should act as a lever and make big class of products easy to prototype compared to traditional programming languages.

Goodly makes it easy for employers to offer student loan repayment benefits. Our platform allows employers to make monthly payments directly to employees' student debt. Similar to a 401k to pay down student loans.

Offering student loan benefits as an incentive for recruiting and retaining top employees and to foster diversity and inclusion has become increasingly essential for employers. Student loan benefits rank as one of the most desirable employee benefits for millennial and gen z employees.

When we looked at existing options, it was clear that the market does not have a great solution for employers that want to offer student loan benefits. Current options are difficult to implement, expensive, and have limited resources for employees.

Goodly will:
Benefits administrator: implement plans, enroll employees, verify student loans, and facilitate payments.

Trestle

People working together is what drives companies, and Trestle is how they’ll know who they should be collaborating with, how to work with them best, and who the experts are for any given task. As organizations grow close to and past Dunbar’s number (150 people), it becomes nearly impossible for people in the organization to know who each other are. Employees are often put into situations where they don’t know the people in their next meeting, they don’t know the right person to talk to for help with a task, and they don’t even know that much about the people who work right next to them. Trestle is a website that connects people within companies. Each company has their own Trestle “homebase”, similar to a Slack workplace. Inside of a Trestle homebase, each employee gets their own personal page that allows them to share their name, picture, best ways to contact them, a short bio, areas of expertise, past projects, where they sit, and much more. Trestle homebases also act as a hub of company-wide happenings, the frontpage containing a company calendar with upcoming events, birthdays, anniversaries, plus recent announcements and new hires.

We have software that matches freelance programmers with jobs. We’re bootstrapping the marketplace by scraping all freelance and remote/contract programming jobs that we find on the Internet. Our pattern-matching software applies metadata to gigs (on-site vs remote, full-time, part-time, project-based, etc.), and it falls back to our human data team in cases where the information can’t be inferred. We have one machine learning model (SVMs using uni-,2-,3-grams) but will have more to fully automate this once we have a bigger, well-labeled, structurally sound dataset. (I’m not a machine learning expert, so we leverage a SaaS for our machine learning, but I did take lots of college level math and also know the relevant essentials, such as Garbage In, Garbage Out).

Standard Treasury
S13
Successful
We are building APIs for commercial banking services by building on top of multiple large banks.

If someone needs advice they can call Goldman. If they just need to transact then they can use one of our APIs. We will build commercial banking middleware that will sit on top of banks just like Twilio sits on top of multiple phone carriers. It is much easier because we'll have (mostly) RESTful APIs with good documentation, etc, and (if we choose) cheaper because of bulks rates.

1) Delivered programmatically, using good APIs - Anything transactional shouldn't involved a human being. Most banks suck at technology and admit that. They're excited to have us resell their services.

2) Narrow to start, but ultimately broad services - We want to abstract away the pain of dealing with banks for transactional services like ACH, F/X, wires, factoring, short-term loans, etc, just as Stripe, Braintree, and others have done for getting a Merchant ID. We are starting with ACH and F/X as foundational products.

3) Multiple banking partners - We're willing to endure the pain of setting up commercial contracts with many banks and then offering the transactional services (via API) in an intelligently routed way. We've gotten verbal agreement from Wells Fargo, and are pretty far along with JPMorgan and Capital One. Will start with other banks shortly.

Venmo for Brick & Mortar Retail, not just P2P. Credit card fees are the single biggest pain point for retailers and can eat up to 50% of their profits. With our initial product, we’ve reduced the number of credit card transactions for our retailers by nearly 25%.

Regular ACH is slow to clear, so it doesn’t work in retail. To solve this we link bank account and a credit card to user’s phone. Retailers get paid right away after a purchase. If the money is not in user’s account, we put a hold on user’s credit card. Then we collect funds via ACH. If that fails, then we charge the credit card.

We make money from retailers. We get users because retailers push our app to avoid credit card fees and because we offer users free P2P transfers and cash back on some purchases.

We've built a marketplace that connects researchers (from both academia and industry) with instant, high quality, global research participants. On top of that, we've built infrastructure for research: Prescreening tools (from niche segments to nationally representative samples), user validation software (to ensure high data quality), and research tools (e.g., longitudinal functionality allowing researchers to follow up with participants over weeks or months).

We're going to build (1) tools for data reuse (to reduce research redundancy and waste), (2) the infrastructure to experiment with different incentive structures (e.g., micro payments, bonus payments), (3) a mobile app so participants can earn money taking part in research from their phone, when convenient, and researchers can ask the right questions at the right time (e.g., contextual surveys based on location, time of day etc.), and (4) an API platform (so anyone can tap our trusted and diverse participants). We have several customers interested in plugging their experimental/survey software into Prolific to allow their customers to easily access participants without needing to manage their own audience product. The next scale.ai/usertesting.com could be built on top of the reliable participants we already have, allowing for an ecosystem of people-powered tools that wouldn't be built otherwise. Just like Stripe is the go-to financial infrastructure layer for most YC startups, we hope to be the go-to infrastructure layer for "human responses".

We’re building a personalised food ordering app with tailored health tracking.

Our app allows for pre-ordering, at-table ordering, split bills via Bluetooth, reservations, messaging, customisable health tracking and ways to earn money by creating events, curating menus/venues or serving meals from a home.

Through web-scraping, we’ve indexed over 1 million venues from around the world and use order-forwarding to submit orders to venues that aren’t connected to Streamplate with pre-existing services like UberEats and DoorDash. This means that on the app, we allow users to order from not just cafes, pubs and restaurants, but also supermarkets, corner stores and gas stations.

The idea is that when a user opens the app, they see what they want. Once our app has stabilised we’d like to consolidate our recommendation system to minimise the number of clicks a user has to make to “find” what they’re looking for.

We are developing an AI-powered operating system, VisionOS, for low-cost security cameras that will enable them to detect objects such as people, vehicles, or animals in a live video.

Today, these security cameras lack the ability to detect objects in a live video feed as object detection is computationally expensive and the low powered hardware of a security camera makes it impossible to do so.

We are making a note taking tool that lets users find notes in seconds, no matter how many notes they have.

If you are familiar with tools like Roam and Obsidian, then you're familiar with Dendron. We provide the same functionality as the aforementioned apps but tuned for our custom hierarchical note taking engine. This engine lets users create notes using flexible hierarchies.

These notes can be found again by searching their path in the hierarchy, a process we call "lookup". Through lookup, users can find any specific note in seconds no matter how many notes they have.

These notes are stored locally on the user's file system and can be synced via tools like Git and Dropbox or Dendron's (upcoming) native cloud sync. Users are also able to publish all or a subset of their notes as a website where they can find their notes using the same hierarchical engine that they use locally.

The current implementation of Dendron is an open-source, markdown- based, note-taking tool that runs as an extension inside VSCode.

FLEX is worn internally, was designed for 12 hours of wear, and has the added benefit of mess-free period sex. It is disposable, is not linked to toxic shock syndrome, and is so comfortable, women tell us that they forget that they’re on their period when wearing it.

We built an iOS app that offers 5-minute meditations for life situations throughout the day. For example, meditations to reduce anxiety before a meeting, improve focus at work, and sleep better.

Meditations are recorded by top meditation teachers from all over the world — we currently have over 100 teachers on our platform and are listened to by [redacted].

Our goal is to build the world's leading platform for mindfulness and meditation content. We want to help millions of people learn to live more mindfully and be more resilient.

Seeing Interactive (Own Local)

A local business directory sold through small-town newspapers. The goal is to integrate hyper-local community and business information into a format that users can trust in their small towns.

The directory will be branded as the newspaper's own, allowing businesses to update their information, add photos, news, and daily specials. Consumers will be able to comment and review. Eventually businesses will be able to pick a domain name and template to have a full-fledged website with the ability to sell their products on the internet. Think the Yellowpages plus Yahoo! Merchant Solutions divided by Angie's List.

By leveraging trust that small newspapers have with their local advertisers we will create a nation wide network of businesses that feels local.

Meanwhile, we automate and streamline every news-delivery task that we possibly can. The eventual goal is to create an all-encompassing online suite of tools for small newspapers: we won't be happy until small, ailing newspapers are able to cut their workforce by 30%. Eventually we will provide the tools necessary to abandon print media altogether

OpenPhone is a phone system equipped with CRM capabilities, built from the ground up to fit the needs of small businesses.

Through our mobile application, small business owners get a simple yet powerful business phone system with a dedicated phone number on top of their existing mobile devices.

We are not just another phone system though. We start by owning the communication channel and then use that data to help small businesses communicate better and earn more money.

Some of the values our product will offer are:

Giving businesses full control over their phone system right from their mobile devices (personalized voicemail, greeting, business hours, etc)
Enriching their texting experience with other interactions such as appointment scheduling, sending/requesting docs/signatures/payments and more
Allowing them to share the responsibility of their business phone with their colleagues or partners
Integrating with their existing systems to bring all communications and customer data to one place
Helping them manage their relationships and close more deals

Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team's computers. It's much better than uploading or email, because it's automatic, integrated into Windows, and fits into the way you already work. There's also a web interface, and the files are securely backed up to Amazon S3. Dropbox is kind of like taking the best elements of subversion, trac and rsync and making them "just work" for the average individual or team. Hackers have access to these tools, but normal people don't. It's currently in private beta and I add batches of people every few days.

There are lots of interesting possible features. One is syncing Google Docs/Spreadsheets (or other office web apps) to local .doc and .xls files for offline access, which would be strategically important as few web apps deal with the offline problem.

We decided to start-up together after one of us - Abhijit decided to solve a crucial problem that he faced during his first job in a big government power company.

At the time, the company was using archaic methods to layout the expansion plan of new transmission lines across multiple regions. They brought together data from multiple tools such as AutoCAD, Excel sheets, Garmin GPS, and Google Earth geolocation data, which were painstakingly collected through ground surveys. No application was available that could do interoperability of these tools. This had to be done manually by copying and pasting from one tool to another. On top of it, google APIs were available to get the elevation data along a line.

Observing this opportunity, Abhijit roped in Muneeb and created a desktop application that helped in interoperability of these tools and extraction of elevation data. A downloadable product with a licensing fee was launched. After realizing that the product could be also sold to construction industry, I joined the firm in 2014.We sold the product to 10+ land survey firms, generating a total revenue of 1m INR (US $15k).

We could not scale further as there were only a handful of power and construction firms in India and many big ones had internally developed tools that they were not willing to move away from.

A paper from 2014, “Phrases that Predict Success on Kickstarter” (http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw14.crowdfunding.mitra.pdf) resulted in many conversations outside of academia, with entrepreneurs wanting this as a product. Christian and Eric worked closely together throughout the summer of 2016 on a project called HackGT@UPC as one of the first international, collaborative hackathons. With Eric’s faculty oversight, Christian built this event over the course of a few months around the subject of “assistive technologies” (https://hack-gtupc.devpost.com/). How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person? Tanu and Christian met through Professor Eric Gilbert at Georgia Tech about 2 months ago. Eric is currently Tanu's PhD advisor and Christian worked with Eric as his teaching assistant during the GT study abroad program in Barcelona, Spain last summer. When Tanu came to Eric about turning her PhD research project into a full-blown company, Eric immediately thought of Christian.

Starting in September 2010, all three cofounders began working on a venture called PYP Media, which was the predecessor to The Daily Muse. We had two co-founders at the time who were not a good fit, which led to a split in July 2011 after which we formed The Daily Muse (see below).

TLDR: During university we made £14,000 in revenue and over £5,000 profit in just 5 days! selling Breaking Bad Halloween costumes.

The Story

As sad as we were that Breaking Bad show was coming to an end, we also saw it as an opportunity to cash in on some extra cash.

We realised that the show was ending right before Halloween, so it was obvious to us that there would be a huge demand for breaking bad Halloween costumes due to the shows immense popularity.

We sold each costume on a 5 day lead time but bought everything on next day delivery. This meant we never held any stock and never had to make upfront investments into stock, perfect for students.

We sold the costumes on a one-page website, eBay and Etsy. Unfortunately, we had to stop selling the costumes a little early as there were very little yellow chemical grade hazmat suits left in the UK.

We took the idea of a RSA token combined with the idea of Foursquare check-ins to produce a device that validates whether someone is really in a store. We built the hardware together beginning from breadboard prototypes to fully enclosed and polished product. We did this so that we could scale to more locations with lower cost. We learned a lot from doing this but ultimately had to do a pivot because it didn’t solve a painful enough problem for retailers.

Before working on this idea we were building a chatbot that could answer questions by searching inside videos like: “When was this taught in this lecture?” and it would pinpoint the location in the video when it happened. The demo is available on the website:

https://learnvenue.com/#demos – “Spoken Phrases demo”

We made progress with the chatbot and reached out to the CMO of India’s largest online course provider. He looped in his fellow CXOs and VPs in a video call with us to understand the product. We then had to back out as they literally asked us to log into our servers and show how it’s done.

After this debacle, we reached out to other online course providers and they were all very keen on using this technology but they couldn’t find a prominent use case for it. We then extended this idea to searching real-world objects inside videos such as people, vehicles, or animals. While working on this problem we realized that our computers were painfully slow to analyze videos for objects – this was the premise of this startup.

Startup Soda also provides a vehicle for me to give freely to others in the community. For example I promote new startups, events and initiatives and help make introductions amongst my network.

High school produces much that is sub-impressive. One result for us, now 12 years in the running, was the creation of an international holiday. Mind you, it is only celebrated by about 100 people--but we have met people outside of our influence, and even from other countries, who celebrate the day.

Observed on Dec. 27th and known as the "twenty-seventh" or "the new day". We created the day in response to the nonsensical notion of people being over-excited about the new year, when in fact it is just another day. Festivities include your standard revelry on the evening of Dec. 26th, followed by the collective singing of Louis Armstrong's rendition of "What a Wonderful World" to bring in the day

A while ago, we did a fun little project together called Milkshake. Using the app, users could express what they were up to at anytime by using up to 3 emojis, their location, and optionally an image.

Our assumption was that the barrier to post a good picture on Instagram or tweet something interesting was too high and most people didn’t create content on those platforms often enough.

Maybe if people were constrained to 3 emojis and their location to express what they were up to, they would not feel too much pressure to post content.

During the prototyping phase, we learned that although creating content was easier, the generated content was not interesting enough for users to scroll through every day.

All three founders met while working together at McKinsey & Company in the summer of 2008. We have worked together on numerous McKinsey-­related projects throughout 2008, 2009, and 2010, culminating in the Takalani Sesame 10­-year strategic planning and review described above.

In September 2010, KMinshew and ACavoulacos founded their first company together, PYP Media, with two other ex-­McKinsey women. We quickly brought MMcCreery in as our first employee and Managing Editor. PYP grew quickly and won a Forbes' award for Top Websites for Women under Kathryn and Alex's leadership and Melissa's editorial direction, but some jockeying for control by founders #3-­4 led to the disbanding of the founding team (pre-­funding) and the formation of The Daily Muse in July 2011, with KMinshew, ACavoulacos, and MMcCreery as co­founders. It was a painful and an expensive learning experience ­ but a great one for us to have so early on. Needless to say, we've learned some pretty incredible lessons from the failure of our first company.

[For reference, we worked closely with Bo Yaghmaie at Cooley LLP to make sure our new company was 100% legally kosher, and we're good.]

Yes, I am committing one of the cardinal sins in the world of startups. I am a solo founder, but let me take this opportunity to tell you a little bit more about me and why being a solo founder isn’t the end of the world.

I purchased my first business, a retail surf shop as a 16 year old high school student (~12 years ago now). No, I wasn’t a trust fund kid, and didn’t get a handout from my mum or dad. I did it through hard work and sacrifice. Here’s how…..

I started working when I was 11. I had multiple paper runs and saved every dollar I earned. When I was 12 I taught myself how to invest on the stock market and found a way to get comisión del 0% sobre las acciones (0% commission on the shares) I bought. This was before apps like Robinhood so I was investing $500 per company (all my money at the time) and self-taught myself both fundamental and technical trading analysis. Nowadays the stock market looks a little different, especially with the cryptocurrency angle, with people constantly searching for how they can start with these cryptocurrencies/jak zaczac z kryptowalutami so they can get on the investment ladder and start earning money.

When I was 14 I got my first job (McDonald’s). When I was 15 I got a break. I found a new job at a hardware store that didn’t have an “award wage” (basically like minimum wage) for anyone under 18. I went from earning $5 an hour to $15.

The catch? I had to work Saturday and Sunday, plus an afternoon or two mid-week. This combined with my paper runs meant I often earned $500 per week or more.

Now this is where buying a business as a 16 year old comes into play. There as a retail surf shop across the road from the hardware store where I worked and on my lunch break I saw the “For Sale” sign. I reached out to the owner and after a couple of months negotiated the price down to stock value only, or $20,000.

It took all my savings, but I did it. And in July 2005 I became the owner of the store (which I would rename to Liquid Surf) and employed a team of up to 3 staff. I ran the business for almost 3 years (while still at high school) and it taught me more about business than any text book or blog post ever has.

Our immediate goal: Get our prototype so good that a single one of our alpha testers uses Simula for more than 1hr/day.

Current engineering plan: Our current prototype uses an ad hoc rendering system that is inadequate for serious usage. To address this, we’ve decied to incorporate Simula into the Godot (open source) game engine, which just recently has added support for OpenVR/HTC Vive. This will fix our current rendering problems (low FPS, stutteriness, etc), and get us to a prototype that will actually be usable for serious work in VR.

Starting in 2014, Tanu has been working on this model, the science and the technologies surrounding it for about 3 years now. Our first major paper (http://credcount.com/whitepaper) was reviewed and published in late 2014 in a top CS conference. Although the majority of the work such as data collection was finished in approximately 8 or so months, there are certain analyses that have taken place up until today. That said, we are in what we consider the prototyping stage: the service/technology in its current form is not suited to any specific market but rather a proof of concept. With a little bit of modification to the machine learning models, we feel as though we can target new markets in as little as a couple weeks. Thus, Christian has spent the last few months trying to identify where we fit and have the biggest effect as a company/product. So far, we’ve considered news, politics, finance and the public sector. With contacts such as news anchor George Howell from CNN, political advisor and campaign manager Jason Boles and Senior Vice President of investments Mr. Jeff Wolk from Raymond James in the financial sector, we feel as though our best fit at this moment is to ride the “fake news” wave. Currently there is no window dressing to our model. In its current form, it is command-line driven (literally “python model.py [input]”), but we feel as though who our potential customers might be should be identified before we begin to work on any sort of graphical interface and/or API. That’s why we’ve come to YC. Our idea currently is a product/application built around our technology as an easy to use display of current news items and their credibility rankings such that someone might be able to read through an article with a presumed level of bias or accuracy up front. It comes through the narrative of “news literacy” and an attempt to have all sides of every story. Think if every fact or bullet from a news article could have a certain score for credibility such that the least items with the least standing fall to the way side and only the true and solid facts of the situation are left. How long have each of you been working on this? Have you been part-time or full-time? Please explain. Tanu has been working on CredCount since early 2014 as part of her PhD in social computing with her advisor Eric Gilbert at Georgia Tech. The majority of data collection and analysis led into early 2015, and she’s continued to circle back to it in a “part-time” role as a project with the most potential as a product/service outside of academia. Christian joined on early this year, 2017, in a product manager capacity to build this paper/model into a business. Working part-time while taking classes since his joining, he’s found himself devoting more time towards this venture than schoolwork, such that Tanu and Christian both are ready to commit to the project for the summer and however long after that.

Pic ur Photo is a live, revenue generating startup that has been growing weekly paying customers by an average of 10% per week for the last 4 months.

We have proven that the low entry barrier of £5/photo entices people who had never had a photoshoot before, but that hasn’t stopped them from spending: an average customer spends £36 ($50), with many spending in excess of $150, and one person bought 101 photos, stemming from a 30 minute photoshoot.

We’ve managed to increase users, while also increasing average cart sizes by over 100%, adding new dedicated photographers, and accepting well over 100 more applications from photographers who want to be part of what we’re building.

In addition, people have even come asking us to do their weddings, birthdays, and other special events. We’ve gained our customers’ trust, and these events aren’t our focus now, but this model is easily transferable.

Our customers totally get it, and they’re proud to share us with their friends. We see daily posts of our users tagging us in their photos and short clips from the shoot, of their private gallery, and telling people they want to book every location.

W18
Unsuccessful
I have a bit over $3000 MRR. I also generate revenue from consulting and facilitating billing of projects through our system – highest in a month is about $66,000. For example, instead of writing code for my consulting clients, I find Code For Cash subscribers to do it for them, charge a 5%-10% markup, invoice my clients and then pay the developers. In that way I’m “dogfooding” the app (as a hiring manager). This, however, is not the long-term plan, since I’m essentially subcontracting. But everything I do to facilitate these transactions could definitely be automated by smart enough software and processes, which I am in the process of building. In that way, with good enough software, we could eventually wipe out agencies and recruiters – perhaps even managers! – just through process-driven software.

Slite

I wrote the first line of code 1 year ago, and the journey has been incredible. In a year, we designed and developed a real-time desktop app with a full-featured collaborative editor, with no technical debt.

We built an incredible team with the right skills in product and development. I kicked-off Slite technically, built the first version of it, and found Pierre and Arnaud, our 2 first senior developers. They had respectively built a chrome note editor with more than 50K users and a B2B collaborative business plan editor. More than their technical skills and experience, the cornerstone of Slite has been our human fit.

We launched our private beta 5 months ago, and with no public communication, we have a gathered a great set of beta testers, companies from 3 to 120 users, giving us incredibly useful feedback.

It allowed us to fix the remaining weaknesses of the product in order to launch our public beta in October. To handle this, we are now a team of 7, with 4 amazing developers, a sales, a marketing person, and myself handling the product.

I've been working on a web app since November and `rake stats` shows me 615 lines of code and 415 lines of test code.

How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so, how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If so, how much? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in users or revenue or both)?

The web app is live – it allows users to sign up to access videos, lecture notes, tracks progress and generates certificates – and serves around 500 unique users per day.
As we're still bootstrapping, all of our users come in and pay through other educational platforms like Skillshare, Udemy, General Assembly, and
Appsumo.
Upcoming features include payment processing through the app, multiple paths to build different kinds of apps, and the ability to see progress on a user-by-user basis.

So far over 6,000 users have paid between $20-50 each to sign up and the feedback is incredibly positive.
We've generated over $80,000 in revenue with almost no cost. When we opened up the most recent class, 3,000 paid users signed up in two weeks (40% growth week over week versus previously).

I have been working on Task Pigeon for over 18 months now. During this time I have worked full time hours on Task Pigeon each and every week but do still hold down another job (with the view to go full time on Task Pigeon ASAP).

I understand that this is often not viewed favorably but I would argue that I put in just as much if not more effort than the majority of founders out there. I have sacrificed a lot to ensure I have the time to dedicate to Task Pigeon with early mornings, late nights and letting go of a number of hobbies/sports I previously pursued.

Furthermore deciding to retain my job for the time being was a conscious decision I made. Having that income allowed has me to invest more in Task Pigeon and ultimately provides an endless runway of funding so that I can continue to test and iterate where required in order to achieve our ultimate goal of empowering individuals and teams to get more done each day/week.

Our first product is nearly ramen profitable. Although our current product is in a market that is rapidly losing value -- print to web ad conversion -- it still helps us build relationships with these newspapers and makes them money (adds about 5% to their bottom line).

Our ultimate goal is to get the number of people using Simula for more than 1hr/day from 0 to 1, and then grow that number 10% week-over-week until we can convince an HMD manufacturer to install Simula natively on their headset.

The developers pay for the software because it helps them find jobs; the hiring managers pay for a license to the software as long as they are working with a contractor sourced through Code For Cash (if they hire additional developers, they pay for additional “seats” to the software); the coding bootcamp pays a flat fee to provide developer-level membership for all its students.

I showed you our MRR from Recurly subscriptions, but a few of our early customers subscribed with SendOwl, so our actual MRR is about $500 higher (~$3300).

I’m also leveraging the Code For Cash product itself to do consulting work in order to fund development of the platform – for example, instead of writing code for my consulting clients, I find Code For Cash subscribers to do it for them, charge a 5%-10% markup, invoice my clients and then pay the developers. In that way I’m “dogfooding” the app (as a hiring manager).

There are also the book sales: The Software Engineer’s Guide to Freelance Consulting and 30 Days To Your First Freelance Programming Client are both published on Amazon and available for $2.99, selling ~13 copies a day (in the Top 10 – Kindle Paid – Software Development category).

We pivoted. Our first product - ClearBook was a bookkeeping android app for the small stores to accurately track profit and cash in hand. We grew this app to 5,000 downloads and 200 DAU with zero marketing spend.

However, after spending time with around 200+ customers of ClearBook in Bangalore, we understood that frequent stock-outs are a bigger problem for the stores. This leads to revenue loss and at times, even customer churn. Although this problem is more operationally complex to solve, it is a bigger pain point for them, and the solution is also monetizable from day 1.

1. We have updated our prototype to support the HTC Vive (as opposed to the older Oculus D2K) and tested it against 6 alpha testers. It is still not good enough for a single one of these testers to use it for more than 1hr/day, so we’re continuing to focus on product development at the expense of everything else (we don’t have a website, vanity metrics, etc).

2. After working with us for a year, David Kraeutmann – the person responsible for most of our codebase – has been added to our founding team.

3. We started sending monthly updates to our network to increase transparency/pressure; you can see our monthly updates here: https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula/wiki/Monthly-Update:-2017.12.31

4.Carl Wheeler has been funding the project entirely through crypto market activity (in particular: by syndicating and participating in the pre-ICOs of other startups). This sounds crazy, but it has given us the ability to fund the project without raising money, and increases the chances we’ll be able to survive long enough to have an impact. It has also, as a side benefit, opened our minds to the possibility of a token-based business model (see our answer to “How could you make money?”).

We’ve relaunched our platform, and opened fulltime availability in various locations around London. We’ve added new dedicated photographers, and have had more applications from photographers who want to be part of what we’re building.

Additionally, we’ve introduced a commision-based “street team”. We’ve improved our software, data, vetted new hotspots, and tried out the platform in Berlin, San Francisco, and Paris.

We’ve created jobs for creatives like me. Take our photographer, Paul, for example: musician by passion, with stunning images on his instagram and professional equipment, but holds a normal (boring) job. We’ve created a platform where we can fund his passion for music, while still doing something he loves. He works for us part time, but has expressed he’s ready to quit his other job at the earliest opportunity.

There’s a high entry barrier to starting a freelance photography business, so many people like Paul wouldn’t bother, but they’re perfect candidates, because they’re creative and have likeable personalities.

We’ve collected an enormous amount of information, and we’ve discovered that photos are changing. People don’t want to look like models in their photos (staged), nor do they want to look like blatant tourists, and most photographers cater to one of those two things. They want–and they respond to–photos inspired by real life.

Yes, we applied with the same idea for YC Summer 2018. We have made a considerable progress on finding product-market fit since. The most radical change has been our adoption of a social strategy around books.

Readers want to talk about what they have read with their friends. They often share insights, annotations or recommend the title itself to their friends. We introduced a few simple features to let them do that on major social networks and it resulted in an N! magnification in referrals and word of mouth.

We are now calling ourselves 'a social book reader for web'! :-)

PMAlerts
S21
Unsuccessful
Product changes:
- I'm now exposing the "Listeners" construct publicly. Listeners are the little pieces of code that query (via APIs, crawling, scraping) the supported platforms. In the future, I'd like for any developer to be able to easily build a listener of their own for niche sites/forums. Listeners are listed here: https://www.pmalerts.com/listeners
- I'm also exposing PMAlerts Internals now. This lets anyone track PMAlerts KPIs, and helps keep me accountable to effective prioritization / growth / improvement: https://www.pmalerts.com/internals
- Many of my existing users reported receiving noisy results. I've since implemented thumb ratings on results so you can grade your results as either good or bad. This helps "train" PMAlerts to improve relevance over time (right now it's just me manually tweaking things on my end, but this seems like a categorization problem that ML could help with).
- One paying customer asked for a UberPeople.net listener, which I was able to spin up quickly because of the generalized "listeners" construct: https://www.pmalerts.com/listeners/UberPeople

Perspective/priority changes:
- In the short term, I think PMAlerts can make money by giving PMs an easy way to get closer to their customers, and by giving B2B sales professionals an easy way to "social sell". One long-term possibility is that PMAlerts becomes a thin layer on top of all social media sites that lets people build their own social media feeds (or maybe subscribe to others'). Another long-term possibility is that PMAlerts becomes the go-to social selling tool, and then works its way down the funnel for businesses of all kinds, tracking conversion from initial engagement all the way down to retained, paying customer - "salesforce for everyone" / "sales as a service".

Monthly Recurring Revenue has gone from zero to over $3300.

We’ve found five unique customer acquisition channels.

We learned that freelance developers really hate paying referral fees, even if they wouldn’t have found the work otherwise, and would rather pay a flat rate.

We learned that hiring managers vary in their price sensitivity according to how tech-savvy they are: for example, a nontechnical founder is willing to pay a $200/month/developer recruitment fee, but a technical founder would pay one-time flat fee <$200, if that. We learned that there are more w2 developers in USA than freelance developers due to tax reform legislation that was passed in 1986. We’ve grown our customer base from fewer than 5 subscribers to over 60 active accounts, and increased our prospect list (e.g. purchasers of our books and mailing list signups) to over 2,000. We’ve identified the size of the market using top-down as well as bottom-up estimates and identified some key players (in the freelance programming platform market: Upwork, Guru, Freelancer; ancillary competitors: IT staffing firms like Randstad; development agencies like YC-funded Gigster). We have improved the product from barely a crontab, some ruby scripts, and a mysql database into a webapp with 6 major functional areas, (Preferences, CRM, Portfolio webpage, Training Materials, Share An Opportunity, Search [this is really just Algolia]). We search 40+ markets for jobs instead of just 10+. We filed for incorporation and started preparing essential legal documents, started to open a business bank account, and hired a bookkeeper to label all of our transactions in our accounting software. We’ve grown to understand the importance of culture fit (communication) during the freelancer hiring process, as well as the importance of having a specification/scope of work for freelance projects in order to ensure both parties are successful (we haven’t implemented this, structurally, into the webapp yet, but we will). We learned that freelance developers immensely care about time commitment when searching for work, and like to search based on a fulltime, part-time, or project-based commitment. I learned that developers respond very well to transparency, as do hiring managers. Despite relying on it as a livelihood, freelance developers dislike sales, so creating a “pull” approach to placement (that results in getting matched to a paycheck very quickly) rather than a “push” approach will be adopted very quickly. The main hurdles for a software development project not getting started are: manager doesn’t trust developer; developer doesn’t trust manager; project doesn’t have a specification yet; manager doesn’t know what a fair price is; developer doesn’t know how to bid the project. (Most of such problems are solvable through the right software). Developers are willing to take a chance on new platforms and see if they quickly get matched with a project that’s a good fit. So a smarter-matching engine is essential, as is a high volume of projects. The list goes on…

We’ve applied before with different iterations of the same company.

Our biggest learning has been that just selling online courses doesn’t cut it for most content creators. In order to attract high-ticket customers, online educators must turn to provide premium options to their students which includes real-time support either in 1-on-1 or group setting rather than just pre-recorded video.

On the consumer side, we learned that for consumers to pay high-ticket prices ($1,000+) for any online educational program, it has to have very high ROI, often meaning transformational for their life and/or career. We’ve decided to double down on empowering career education, specifically mid-career education.

Courier

Successful
Most companies that support multi-channel notifications have to build that support internally. Twitch just launched their "Smart Notifications", built by an internal engineering team. Existing multi-channel offerings (Amazon Pinpoint, Twilio Notify, etc.) usually only support a couple of channels - and they only support themselves as providers for those channels. Courier is agnostic to the underlying provider, similar to Segment, Zapier, etc.

There is no distributor/company in the market that supplies to the stores within the same day, let alone in 2 hours. As of now, the only substitute that the stores have for stocked out products - is to go to the nearby wholesale market/distributor and get the stock replenished by themselves. Else, they suffer sales loss till the time the stock is delivered by a distributor; this is typically between 2 days and 1 week.

MagicBell

Currently, the only substitute is building the notification system in-house. Based on our experiences, and user interviews, it takes a team of two engineers (frontend+backend) and a designer a minimum of two months to build a basic real-time notification center with multi-channel delivery. The team needs to understand and use APIs from Twilio and Pusher, etc. Usage analytics, debugging logs, fine-tuning the UX, or performing any day-to-day maintenance and troubleshooting is even more work.

Supernote (Metlo)
S21
Successful
What’s new: A lot of our features exist in disparate open source software but there’s no one tool that a Data Scientist or ML Engineer can use to manage their whole workflow. These features individually solve annoying problems but not big enough that customers would want to pay for them. However, we think that a bundle of all these tools (Supernote) is much more valuable and crosses the threshold to something people will pay for.

Substitutes: The most common DS workflow today is training a model on local jupyter notebooks or google colab notebook (for more savvy people who work at companies that allow it), testing it out with an example set of arguments and then putting it into a python script that they then upload to GCP cloud functions/AWS lambda to deploy it. There’s no good collaboration solution so people often just share screenshots in slack. The DS’ who are technically savvy and understand git sometimes use git for versioning, most just don’t save versions over time.

AthleteNet (FamilyLeaf)
W12
Successful
What's new about our product is that we plan to build in social and viral mechanics from the very beginning and focus on maintaining a search-friendly database for athlete data. Older and existing solutions would be much more useful (and more easily monetized) if the data they collected was searchable and organized. Also current website-builders for teams do not allow athletes to create their own profile without a team - we will allow for that and make it extremely easy and beautiful. Along with using eTeamz, coaches currently send forms to players for profile information, get the information emailed back to them, then enter the data into MS Word templates, convert those into PDF's, upload each of them to the web, and manually link a player's name to the URL of the PDF.

My approach is the antithesis of the command and control approach of academia and other apps. The user picks the content they want to study and my app does all of the grunt work, organizing references, keeping track of words studied, looking up words, etc. Additionally I focus on using the language to achieve concrete goals. I.e. I’ve read 2 books in Japanese, watched 4 episodes of this show and learned 3 songs.

Currently the best solution is to hire a tutor to help you. Failing that, people do it by hand with a pen, notebook, and dictionary. These are expensive and arduous. Language apps don’t make any effort on user selected content, which my interviewees often mention. They also talk about trying various approaches such as guides published by self-proclaimed language gurus or seeking out side-project projects such as ReadLang, Rikai-chan, Yomitori or Learning with Texts to make the process less painful. At best these address one or two obvious pain points, such as making defining words easier. But as mentioned above they are all toy solutions that are difficult to set up, have a poor UI, and have no support.

We want to make it as easy as setting up an API account with us to get started with fulfillment. No one else has made it that easy to start providing fulfillment solutions for companies.

Typically, start-ups go two different routes.

1. They do the fulfillment themselves. This means a large portion of their effort is taken away from product development and marketing.
2. They find a 3PL. Often times, they are overpaying and the facilities are initially misinformed about the product which delays shipments.

To find warehousing today is a long and arduous process of calling individual facilities to see if they can manage a given product. Each warehouse has a slightly different pricing structure, different process of fulfillment, and different understanding of the same product.

Basic event analysis has existed in its current form, based on volume and noise alone. The ability to take collective reactions through social media to help determine reliability of a specific event is what we bring to the table. Think of it as a haystack of social media posts and events that finding a needle in is close to impossible. We help shrink this haystack to make fact checking far easier.

One Month Rails (One Month)
S13
Successful
Honestly, the current online resources focused on teaching people how to code just don't cut it. There's a huge but largely unrecognized difference between the kind of skills that sites like Codecademy teach and what people actually want or need to know to build web applications.

At One Month Rails, the focus is on helping someone deploy a web application as quickly as possible. Most of my students have never seen a command line before, and yet they are able to have an application live on Heroku in less than one hour. It's a magical moment.

Maybe it's not defensible, but I feel as if I've discovered a better way to teach non-technical people how to code. People reach out to me every day telling me this is "the best $20" they've ever spent. Most of them have tried to learn how to code before on sites like Codecademy and never succeeded.

The core of the idea is not about education, it's about getting a non-technical person to a fully-functional, beautiful web application as quickly as possible. Right now it happens through engaging video content, but slowly we're identifying big points of friction in the process (like getting the entire development environment set up on a local computer) and eliminating them using technology.

MakeGamesWithUs (Make School)
W12
Successful
We will grow our catalog of games faster and at a lower cost than anyone else in the industry. We don't claim to be able to separate the gems from the duds, but we can rely on metrics to provide merit-based promotion to promising games in our catalog and the gems will carry us to success.

Artist and engineers can find each other on freelancing sites, but to navigate a site like Elance one needs money and knowledge on how to write a contract. Additionally, few publishers will talk to small, independent first-time developers.

Thus, engineers resort to self-publishing lower quality games without great
production value or effective means of promotion.

The Muse
W12
Successful
Members of our target demographic are currently finding jobs primarily via personal connections and occasionally via high­-touch recruiters who charge 20% of starting salary per hire; a small minority uses sites like the Ladders and an even smaller percentage turns to Monster.com, SimplyHired and the like.

The skewed ratios of men to women on these sites is reflective of the research on transactional vs. relationship-­based networking, which is why the content arm of The Daily Muse is extremely important towards attracting and retaining a large pool of qualified women.

No one is currently tackling the "smart content for women" space, and it's one we can begin to capture with front runner advantage. Marie Claire is releasing a special issue on career, which they are consulting us about, and sites like ForbesWomen and Excelle at Monster.com are desperately trying to capture the younger demographic. We have it and we're growing quickly.

Our auction site emphasizes authenticity and safer selling and buying of designer items. We have a unique technique (patent in the works) to help verify an item’s authenticity and the seller’s physical possession of it. This dramatically reduces scams for both buyers and sellers.

Current online auctions only rely on a feedback system. This is not adequate, especially when (for some brands) over half of all items sold are fake! (Most buyers are not expert authenticators.)

YogaTrail

Currently, people find yoga via Google search or word of mouth. The first option is dysfunctional, and the search results not only lack independent reviews but are hard to sift through. The word of mouth thing is suboptimal, especially for travelers.

Not yet live: we plan to add “schedules” to the site, so yogis can see at a glance where and when the classes of their favourite teachers will be. This will solve a major pain for millions of yogis who currently have to go to multiple websites to do this.

Proxino (Taazr)
S10
Successful
Uncaught program bugs are expensive, and for this reason, good developers take care in testing their code. However, even the best test suites will not catch all program bugs. Taazr will identify such bugs earlier in the development cycle, and companies will save money that otherwise might have been spent on code maintenance and customer support.

We believe that statistical debugging is uniquely suited to web applications, due to the relative ease with which web apps can be instrumented through lightweight and unobtrusive javascript. While statistical debugging has succeeded in a research context on desktop software, automatically finding bugs in live web applications remains an open industrial problem.

However, our ultimate aim is not just to find bugs in web applications, but also to fix them. This will likely require tighter integration — server-side — between our tools and a developer’s code.

We’ve created (and are improving) an algorithm that analyses one’s paycheck stub and simulates all loans’ opportunities in a matter of seconds, allowing users to easily compare rates among different banks and get it online.

Such algorithm is able to estimate information about each loan, using the paycheck stub data and combining to data found online and define a score value for that client to make an automatic proposal for users in a matter of seconds.This way, the algorithm plays a huge role in giving convenience and also transparency to our users, and also optimizing deals in our pipeline for action.

For clients, without this solution, the only alternative available today is to personally visit different bank branches, bank correspondents or resort to street brokers’ advices, to get some of the information and wait days until the final approval of their loans.

Plus, as users usually get up to 30 payroll-deductible-loans in their lifetime (because they have the opportunity to get money at such a low interest rate), the algorithm will also be able to help them i.) manage their loans; ii.) pay them back faster, if they want to; iii.) reduce their installments whenever the government reference interest rate goes down; and iv.) borrow more money for the best rates available, whenever they need it again.

Pic ur Photo
S19
Unsuccessful
1) Pic ur Photo curates the best hotspots, and the resulting images inspire people. We have customers who have bucket lists of photos they want to get, and others who travel 4 hours to a specific location they saw on our website, or an experience they want to have.

2) There’s no pressure on our shoots (price, convenience), so our customers end up with photos that are natural. A customer might travel across the country or squeeze it into a lunch break.

3) Pic ur Photo is the first platform where you can see the result before buying the photos you want (you, you know…pick ur photo). We require a minimal deposit, but that money goes into a user’s account as a credit.

4) Pic ur Photo is the first platform where you can see a photo in our content and book that location from within the photo. We do that by predicting and scouting the best photo locations.

5) Photographers set their schedule, and users book. No need for communication about availability, location, portfolio, price…a freelance photographer will typically use 5 different services to run their business (think Squarespace, Dropbox, PayPal, WhatsApp, and other social medias, etc..). Our photographers only use one.

6) The customer doesn’t browse different photographers, and there’s no complicated signup process. Customers book whatever photographer is scheduled in the location on the day they book. And, we have a closer relationship with our photographers than other platforms, meaning we fill up the entire schedule they want to work.

On competing platforms, photographers don’t get enough gigs, get bored, and leave. It might look like an active place, but it’s not (usually). All open slots on our platform can be booked and already have a photographer scheduled to handle them.

People resort to using their smartphones. We’ll take customers from the more traditional photo services industry too, but roughly 80% of our customers had never hired a professional photographer before. People use their smartphones, because they’re convenient and the price is negligible. That’s the market we’re aiming for.

Syllble
W18
Unsuccessful
At the core of what we are building is a decentralized production collab team that allows people to create together in a fun way. We are focused on making a structured process where people can collaborate and explore their creativity in an unfettered way both in person and online. We want to charge people to join a CollabRoom group to create with others original content then connect them with the right people to have their finished product (book) distributed to different markets and audiences (readers and filmmakers). We want to cut out the agent and give people an equal footing in having more access to opportunities of getting their work (seen by the right people) out to the world. Through the collabroom we can address many pain points bring them more accountability, structure and time, confidence in growing as a better writer then having a voice and influence to make a difference in the world.

People go on Reddit to collaborate writing. People even go to college and spend four entire years to learn how to write. People sign up for writing workshops to break their writers block. People submit their screenplays and novels in thousands yet just few a few are picked by major publishing companies and certain narratives that impact the world negatively are repeated.

As for established writers who often lack the wealth from the small royalties they receive, we want to connect them together with other published writers through the collabroom through which they can work to meet Businesses needs and create the kind of unique storytelling that can inspire employees and business leadership as a mean to get paid and find the time to write.

We’re the only organisation in the world that uses in-depth research to help people choose careers that make a difference.

Most career advice doesn’t focus on social impact. When it does, it’s based on anecdote rather than research, and usually confined to one narrow approach e.g. just the charity sector. This means it can’t help you with the big decisions that really matter, like PhD vs. startup vs. Teach for America. Instead, when it comes to these decisions, our audience must put together their own makeshift guidance from friends, mentors and family.

Spreadsheet Magic

# New things

Compared to traditional programming languages:

* Data is visible at each step of processing and can be manipulated directly

* Easy integration with data sources (similar to Zapier)

* Easy visualisation of data at any step

* Can utilise multiple cores, vectorisations and GPUs efficiently because works on arrays of data and typical shape of data is known during development of “program” and can be used by optimising compiler

Compared to spreadsheets:

* Can be scaled to vast amounts of data

* Allows to input/output data among different data sources / web services

* Is targeted toward general purpose programming

* Allows creating new abstractions (functions)

* Can use simple text-based format to allow use of existing version control systems and diff/merge tools

# Substitutes

- Putting together some combination of spreadsheets and shell scripts.

- Copy-pasting CSV data directly into spreadsheets and then uploading processed data as CSV file to web-services (did it myself to load intercom.io data into Mailchimp). Ok as one-off job, but it often has to be repeated all the time.

- Hiring team of software developers to do expensive custom software for business.

Apptimize
S13

Most wait for app store approval and push many changes simultaneously. They eyeball the results and haphazardly rollback suspect changes.

Desperate people resort to basic, home-grown solutions. Because of other projects, Switchboard and Clutch.io evolved incomplete solutions (we noticed errors: randomization mistakes that mess up the experiments, poor error handling, malformed responses that’d crash your app!).

There hasn’t been much focused effort towards creating a seamless AB testing experience for native apps. AB testing for mobile is a technologically harder problem than for websites due to challenges particular to mobile devices (ie. intermittent internet, lack of cookies/iframes, users running different versions). Existing solutions ignore complexity whereas we view handling it as our core business.

Many larger companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe have had to build this in-house, dedicating significant resources to do so and maintain the software. In some cases, this software is built solely during company hackathons and so the end result is often a product that doesn’t provide a cohesive experience, has poor UX, and lacks important features. At smaller companies which are just starting to feel the pain, companies fall back to products such as Slack or HRIS directories which provide only the barest information and lack good search functionality. [redacted], for example, has resorted to using Wordpress as their internal homepage where each employee has a “profile” with their name, picture, and contact info, and there’s a new post every time a new all hands video is posted. This is a clear pain point that companies are facing and I intend to solve that for them.

What's new—We liberate digital books from hardware. The idea is to have books come alive on web without using proprietary formats or vendor lock-ins. A reader need not own a piece of hardware (like Kindle) to enjoy reading digital books. Meaning freedom, flexibility and share-ability etc for books.

What substitutes exist?—Developers use books published on web more than anything else. The mass market reads on the dead tree while the progressive ones are on Kindle that is now over a decade old. Kids are on the iPad, and that's where we are putting all our focus on.

The fastest growing companies are increasingly non-public and rely on totally different metrics than firms like Bloomberg or Morningstar offer. Today VCs do their own analysis to figure out who the hot firms are, we expect to commoditize some of that.

Standard Treasury
S13
Successful
When most businesses wants to do something financial they have to call their bank and talk to a person - except for getting a MID. That doesn't make sense. Getting a wire, as an example, often involves twenty minutes, a painful conversation, and $30. Even non-quant hedge funds needing to convert EURO to GBP have to pick up the phone and talk to a bank's trading desk.

No one has built developer friendly bank back-end processing, so you have to deal with banks, which overcharge, are slow, and are not developer friendly. Wells Fargo, for example, does offers an API which costs more than their other options and, well, is not very good.

We marry the the advantages of ACH (ubiquitous and affordable) and the advantages of credit cards (fast) and put them both in the same product. Our payment system is therefore fast, secure, and affordable.

Right now people are using credit cards, e-transfers, and checks. Credit cards tell retailers whether or not they are going to get paid for what they are selling. But in order to work, they require an asset-heavy and insecure process that costs merchants in the US alone $50 billion a year.

To the extent innovation has existed, it has been on top of existing credit card networks. Because of these innovations, credit card processing has become faster or more broadly available. But because innovations are on top of an obsolete network, credit card processing has also become more expensive.

"People research" is broken: Finding participants is difficult and slow and with other platforms data is biased, low quality, and incentives are misaligned. Researchers want participants and data they can trust, but they resort to platforms which provide disengaged people who signup for pennies, fraudsters and bots, leaving them crying out for higher quality solutions.

We're tackling this by obsessing about trust, data quality, and "truth". We use proprietary user validation, statistical algorithms and machine learning to weed out bots and bad actors which plague the rest. Competitors have no minimum pay policies and often pay next to nothing to their participants leading to misalignment, disengagement and bias or fraud. We have a variety of incentives built in to our platform including pre-qualification for studies, two-way feedback, and guaranteed minimum pay. In addition, researchers can transparently explore the marketplace and get in touch with participants directly. As a result, both sides of the marketplace trust our platform, which means that participants provide high quality data and researchers conduct high quality research.

Our platform also creates virtuous cycles for our community. Demand from researchers attracts further participants to our platform. We leverage our increased supply of participants to innovate, for example enabling researchers to collect nationally representative samples at the click of a button! This virtuous cycle powers our growth. At the moment, many use non-dedicated solutions like Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), which were not developed to solve these problems, and as a result suffer from poor quality and limited feature innovation.

Streamplate

Unsuccessful
Streamplate’s food ordering app is a collection of services to support the broad spectrum of user types given everyone eats and drinks. The logic here is that to become the last food ordering app, we have to be able to support a range of interactions that people have with food/drink outlets. This means not just supporting different ways of ordering, but also showing as many venues as possible.

Our app allows users to pre-order, order from their table, split bills via Bluetooth, create a health tracking dashboard with widgets, reserve and message venues, earn money by curating venues/menus, creating events (eg. market stalls, fundraisers etc) and serving meals from a user’s home.

We also allow order-forwarding which means that when a user orders from a venue that isn’t connected to Streamplate, we forward the order onto a pre-existing service that is with that venue, eg. UberEats or DoorDash.

This also means we allow delivery without having to worry about the overhead of managing a fleet.

Our feature list highlights how Streamplate is an aggregation of a range of pre-existing services, allows users to monetise their eating/drinking experiences and our focus on web-scraping/automating, means we’re looking to be globally accessible from day 1.

We are making new AI models that enable low-cost devices to analyze videos on the device itself, thus eliminating the need for relying on Google and Amazon cloud intelligence or investing money in costly computer hardware. Our AI models can run 62x faster than the current state of the art methods.

In the security space, the video is analyzed only post an incident. Which today is done by humans. ‘Netatmo Presence’ is a security camera that can classify objects such as people, car, and animals in a video.

Recently, Amazon announced ‘Deep Lens’ video camera which is also able to “classify” live video feed and they are targeting it at developers. It is a step in the right direction.

However, we must mention that image classification is not the same as object detection and is at least 20x less computationally expensive.

Plus, there are IP cameras in the market from Nest, Blink, Hikvision that can detect motion and then trigger a notification to the owner. However, it cannot differentiate between a motion caused by innocuous objects, such as pets, and intruders.

Dendron
W21
Successful
People are overwhelmed with information and stuck in "google doc hell" - the condition caused through tools that make it easy to create new notes but difficult to find existing notes. By storing notes in hierarchies and using lookup to reference them, users can find any particular note in seconds even if they have thousands of notes. Just as important, if a user is unable to find a note using lookup, they can be confident that the note doesn't exist. While the concepts of hierarchies are not new, hierarchies have never been used to their full potential in note taking tools. This is because the tooling around them sucks. All note taking tools (and even your file system), supports hierarchies. But besides holding your notes, these hierarchies do nothing but get in your way. You can't use them to find notes. They are difficult to change. They add friction to creating new notes. Dendron gives you all the good parts of hierarchies and takes away the friction.

We take the engineering out of building an online trade school so educators can focus teaching their craft. Our tool streamlines the administrative side of running an online trade school by creating an all-in-one solution for admissions, payment processing, live conferencing, and student management.

Content creators are hacking together a few different tools to replicate this experience on their own: Zoom, Calendly, Facebook groups, Google forms, etc..

1) It costs at least an order of magnitude less than what is being built today.
2) It's designed to work on existing cars.

Americans drive 37 miles per day on average. They sometimes drive while texting, drive while intoxicated, or simply drive while being distracted. People seem to be trying really hard to do other things instead of driving, but so far there aren't many good ways to accomplish this.

Some newer vehicles have advanced cruise control systems that keep the vehicle in the lane during ideal highway driving situations, but drivers aren't supposed to do anything else or even take their eyes off the road. This seems like a band‑aid solution.

Automated CS courses are not new, online coding schools such as Code School and Code Academy have had them for awhile now. What is unique about our platform is that it supports core programming languages such as Java, C, and C# in addition to the web based languages that others support. Also our platform is built to be integrated into schools as classroom courses rather than for individuals to casually learn online. And finally we base all of our algorithms off of machine learning so as we process more and more data, our plagiarism detection system and analytics reports will just keep getting smarter.

Right now, the way a high school starts a CS program is to hire a qualified instructor, have them develop course content based on his or her understanding, and then start teaching. Through interviews with some high school administrators we have come to determine that the average cost for this is around 70k a year. This price point of this in addition to the lack of qualified instructors is what has been stopping High Schools from starting their own CS programs.

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
Task Pigeon augments our task management application with an on-demand marketplace of freelancers.

Why is that important? Well, firstly, existing task management / project management tools are all essentially focused on helping you and your team write things down. They are essentially just a better, more digitized version of pen and paper.

What they all ignore is the underlying issue. That is that, up to 40% of tasks people add to their to do list are never actually completed. So how do you solve that?

The answer is Task Pigeon. For example, let’s say Sarah assigns John a task to complete by Friday, but John’s week ends up getting overloaded with more urgent work. Currently this team would face two options. 1) Delay the task to next week or 2) cancel the task altogether. Task Pigeon introduces a third option and allows you to outsource that task in just a few clicks.

What substitutes exist currently? To achieve this you/your team would first need a task management application. Here our competitors are the likes of Trello, Asana, Monday.com, Wrike and Basecamp. Secondly, you would need to find a platform that allows you to find and source freelancers. Here the two most common options with be Upwork and Freelancer.

The problem with both of these outsourcing platforms is that you have to a) create a job b) wade through ten’s of submissions c) shortlist candidates d) select a candidate e) assign them the job. It all takes so much time. Time that you are not going to bother spending if the task was a 500 word blog post or some internet based research.

Task Pigeon removes all that friction. There is now searching for freelancers, no haggling over the price. Everything is predetermined. You just select the task you want to outsource and we take care of the rest.

23% more sex; it allows a user and their partner to engage in mess-free intercourse (and if her partner is male, he won’t feel much, if anything)
Environmental impact (fewer changes, less packaging and waste)
This market is extremely underserved; women who don’t want to use tampons or pads have very few options other than menstrual cups.

There’s are a couple of important differences between FLEX and menstrual cups. Menstrual cups block the vaginal canal (don’t allow sex), they fill up and must be rinsed and reused. This makes for an awkward experience at work or in a public restroom. Menstrual cups are also difficult to insert (there are four different ways you can fold it before inserting) and remove (mine got stuck), which are huge barriers to adoption. Finally, menstrual cups are reused for 5–10 years, and this is a huge behavior change from disposing tampons. FLEX is disposable and addresses this important concern.

Simple Habit
W17
Successful
In contract to Headspace and Calm who have launched a single 'channel,' we're launching a marketplace — a platform for mindfulness, offering a continuously updated stream of meditation content from a variety of teachers.

We're the first to create a meditation platform that curates content from hundreds of high-quality mindfulness professionals and charge subscriptions for access.

We're also the first to introduce a Spotify-like business model to the meditation space. Mindfulness teachers are paid a portion of our subscription revenue commensurate to the number of times their content is listened to. Users get access to meditation content that is diverse in personality and topics.

Silent retreats and in-person meditation studios are other alternatives, but they aren't accessible to all busy working professionals financially or temporally.

Seeing Interactive (Own Local)

Newspapers have been operating under a failed business model for 10 years.

We're rebuilding newspapers by creating profitable web products and optimizing their sales process with online tools. This both makes money and cuts costs. What's novel is that we're saving the newspaper for their relationships with millions of local businesses, and showing them how to make money again.

What are newspapers doing without us? They are dying:http://www.newspaperdeathwatch.com/ and that doesn't include weeklies. Our products make newspapers money and bring local communities together.

OpenPhone
S18
Successful
At OpenPhone, we are bridging the gap between a phone system and a CRM.

A lot of small business owners rely on a phone system to communicate with their customers. Right now, 86% of them are using their personal phone numbers for business which is both limiting and problematic on so many levels.

Majority of small businesses don’t use a CRM because existing solutions put the burden of data entry on the user. Who’s got time for that?

We change that by owning the communication channel between businesses and their customers. This means that we can help small businesses stay on top of their customer relationships and ultimately close more deals.

Mixpanel
S09
Successful
Mixpanel is going to bring the competitive advantage data-driven companies like Facebook and Slide have to everyone. Instead of just tracking page views and referrals, Mixpanel will let people learn about their customers by tracking interactions and engagement. We’re also going to help them identify and track their conversion funnels — the paths visitors take to registrations, purchases or any other goal page designated by the company.

Today, companies have to spend their most scarce resources, time and money, to build out internal analytic systems specific to their application. These homebrew systems are less robust and insightful than the service we are offering.

Paystack
W16
Successful
What’s new? In Nigeria.. there’s still no way to accept recurring payments or one click payments. The incumbents are big co’s owned by banks and are not interested in innovating.

Buffer
S11
Unsuccessful
– Buffer erases two steps twitter users usually had to take to schedule tweets. The ﬁrst one being setting the time of each individual tweet. The second one being to go to your account in Tweetdeck or Hootsuite in order to schedule from there. With Buffer all you do is hit the Buffer icon on the page you are reading to add more tweets.

– If users are currently not using Buffer, they would be using “normal tweet scheduling”, such as SocialOomph, Hootsuite, Tweetdeck or any of the other about 10 similar services out there.

GitLab
W15
Successful
We offer the a better way of collaborating on digital products ( the feature branch workflow) to organizations that prefer to work on open source tools. Open source is interesting for large companies because they can inspect and modify the code. They also can and do contribute back changes that are important to them. Substitutes are closed source alternatives (GitHub Enterprise, Atlassian Stash) or less functional open source alternatives (Gitorious, Gogs). GitHub currently has a lot of mind-share but they are under- serving the on-premises (behind the firewall) market. We can see us grow into the leading solution for those installations (which is currently the majority of the market). In the long run most software will live on some (hybrid-)cloud and we think there are many ways to differentiate our offering (open source/distributed/integrated). In the short term we are emulating the Netflix strategy, shipping DVD’s (focus on the on-premise installations) when the competitors focus on the video-on-demand (SaaS) offering.

Dropbox
S07
Successful
Most small teams have a few basic needs: (1) team members need their important stuff in front of them wherever they are, (2) everyone needs to be working on the latest version of a given document (and ideally can track what's changed), (3) and team data needs to be protected from disaster. There are sync tools (e.g. beinsync, Foldershare), there are backup tools (Carbonite, Mozy), and there are web uploading/publishing tools (box.net, etc.), but there's no good integrated solution.

Dropbox solves all these needs, and doesn't need configuration or babysitting. Put another way, it takes concepts that are proven winners from the dev community (version control, changelogs/trac, rsync, etc.) and puts them in a package that my little sister can figure out (she uses Dropbox to keep track of her high school term papers, and doesn't need to burn CDs or carry USB sticks anymore.)

At a higher level, online storage and local disks are big and cheap. But the internet links in between have been and will continue to be slow in comparison. In "the future", you won't have to move your data around manually. The concept that I'm most excited about is that the core technology in Dropbox -- continuous efficient sync with compression and binary diffs -- is what will get us there.

Q: What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

Courier

Successful
Most companies that support multi-channel notifications have to build that support internally. Twitch just launched their "Smart Notifications", built by an internal engineering team. Existing multi-channel offerings (Amazon Pinpoint, Twilio Notify, etc.) usually only support a couple of channels - and they only support themselves as providers for those channels. Courier is agnostic to the underlying provider, similar to Segment, Zapier, etc.

Unsuccessful
There is no distributor/company in the market that supplies to the stores within the same day, let alone in 2 hours. As of now, the only substitute that the stores have for stocked out products - is to go to the nearby wholesale market/distributor and get the stock replenished by themselves. Else, they suffer sales loss till the time the stock is delivered by a distributor; this is typically between 2 days and 1 week.

MagicBell
W21
Successful
Currently, the only substitute is building the notification system in-house. Based on our experiences, and user interviews, it takes a team of two engineers (frontend+backend) and a designer a minimum of two months to build a basic real-time notification center with multi-channel delivery. The team needs to understand and use APIs from Twilio and Pusher, etc. Usage analytics, debugging logs, fine-tuning the UX, or performing any day-to-day maintenance and troubleshooting is even more work.

Supernote (Metlo)
S21
Successful
What’s new: A lot of our features exist in disparate open source software but there’s no one tool that a Data Scientist or ML Engineer can use to manage their whole workflow. These features individually solve annoying problems but not big enough that customers would want to pay for them. However, we think that a bundle of all these tools (Supernote) is much more valuable and crosses the threshold to something people will pay for.

Substitutes: The most common DS workflow today is training a model on local jupyter notebooks or google colab notebook (for more savvy people who work at companies that allow it), testing it out with an example set of arguments and then putting it into a python script that they then upload to GCP cloud functions/AWS lambda to deploy it. There’s no good collaboration solution so people often just share screenshots in slack. The DS’ who are technically savvy and understand git sometimes use git for versioning, most just don’t save versions over time.

AthleteNet (FamilyLeaf)
W12
Successful
What's new about our product is that we plan to build in social and viral mechanics from the very beginning and focus on maintaining a search-friendly database for athlete data. Older and existing solutions would be much more useful (and more easily monetized) if the data they collected was searchable and organized. Also current website-builders for teams do not allow athletes to create their own profile without a team - we will allow for that and make it extremely easy and beautiful. Along with using eTeamz, coaches currently send forms to players for profile information, get the information emailed back to them, then enter the data into MS Word templates, convert those into PDF's, upload each of them to the web, and manually link a player's name to the URL of the PDF.

Parsnip
S21
Unsuccessful
My approach is the antithesis of the command and control approach of academia and other apps. The user picks the content they want to study and my app does all of the grunt work, organizing references, keeping track of words studied, looking up words, etc. Additionally I focus on using the language to achieve concrete goals. I.e. I’ve read 2 books in Japanese, watched 4 episodes of this show and learned 3 songs.

Currently the best solution is to hire a tutor to help you. Failing that, people do it by hand with a pen, notebook, and dictionary. These are expensive and arduous. Language apps don’t make any effort on user selected content, which my interviewees often mention. They also talk about trying various approaches such as guides published by self-proclaimed language gurus or seeking out side-project projects such as ReadLang, Rikai-chan, Yomitori or Learning with Texts to make the process less painful. At best these address one or two obvious pain points, such as making defining words easier. But as mentioned above they are all toy solutions that are difficult to set up, have a poor UI, and have no support.

derivative/d (Shotput)
S15
Successful
We want to make it as easy as setting up an API account with us to get started with fulfillment. No one else has made it that easy to start providing fulfillment solutions for companies.

Typically, start-ups go two different routes.

1. They do the fulfillment themselves. This means a large portion of their effort is taken away from product development and marketing.
2. They find a 3PL. Often times, they are overpaying and the facilities are initially misinformed about the product which delays shipments.

To find warehousing today is a long and arduous process of calling individual facilities to see if they can manage a given product. Each warehouse has a slightly different pricing structure, different process of fulfillment, and different understanding of the same product.

CredCount
S17
Unsuccessful
Basic event analysis has existed in its current form, based on volume and noise alone. The ability to take collective reactions through social media to help determine reliability of a specific event is what we bring to the table. Think of it as a haystack of social media posts and events that finding a needle in is close to impossible. We help shrink this haystack to make fact checking far easier.

One Month Rails (One Month)
S13
Successful
Honestly, the current online resources focused on teaching people how to code just don't cut it. There's a huge but largely unrecognized difference between the kind of skills that sites like Codecademy teach and what people actually want or need to know to build web applications.

At One Month Rails, the focus is on helping someone deploy a web application as quickly as possible. Most of my students have never seen a command line before, and yet they are able to have an application live on Heroku in less than one hour. It's a magical moment.

Maybe it's not defensible, but I feel as if I've discovered a better way to teach non-technical people how to code. People reach out to me every day telling me this is "the best $20" they've ever spent. Most of them have tried to learn how to code before on sites like Codecademy and never succeeded.

The core of the idea is not about education, it's about getting a non-technical person to a fully-functional, beautiful web application as quickly as possible. Right now it happens through engaging video content, but slowly we're identifying big points of friction in the process (like getting the entire development environment set up on a local computer) and eliminating them using technology.

Circles

we build on top of health data provided by thousands of tools (Apple Health API, etc.); we help you improve not only track.
Currently, people use 1. journaling, takes ~ 10 minutes twice a day and you never look at it again. 2. Coaches & personal trainers, but it takes them months to get good data about you. 3. Apps: Gyroscope, Oura, Whoop, Apple Health, MyFitnessPal 4.platforms: Headsup Health,..

MakeGamesWithUs (Make School)
W12
Successful
We will grow our catalog of games faster and at a lower cost than anyone else in the industry. We don't claim to be able to separate the gems from the duds, but we can rely on metrics to provide merit-based promotion to promising games in our catalog and the gems will carry us to success.

Artist and engineers can find each other on freelancing sites, but to navigate a site like Elance one needs money and knowledge on how to write a contract. Additionally, few publishers will talk to small, independent first-time developers.

Thus, engineers resort to self-publishing lower quality games without great
production value or effective means of promotion.

The Muse
W12
Successful
Members of our target demographic are currently finding jobs primarily via personal connections and occasionally via high­-touch recruiters who charge 20% of starting salary per hire; a small minority uses sites like the Ladders and an even smaller percentage turns to Monster.com, SimplyHired and the like.

The skewed ratios of men to women on these sites is reflective of the research on transactional vs. relationship-­based networking, which is why the content arm of The Daily Muse is extremely important towards attracting and retaining a large pool of qualified women.

No one is currently tackling the "smart content for women" space, and it's one we can begin to capture with front runner advantage. Marie Claire is releasing a special issue on career, which they are consulting us about, and sites like ForbesWomen and Excelle at Monster.com are desperately trying to capture the younger demographic. We have it and we're growing quickly.

Lollipuff
W13
Successful
Our auction site emphasizes authenticity and safer selling and buying of designer items. We have a unique technique (patent in the works) to help verify an item’s authenticity and the seller’s physical possession of it. This dramatically reduces scams for both buyers and sellers.

Current online auctions only rely on a feedback system. This is not adequate, especially when (for some brands) over half of all items sold are fake! (Most buyers are not expert authenticators.)

YogaTrail
S14
Unsuccessful
Currently, people find yoga via Google search or word of mouth. The first option is dysfunctional, and the search results not only lack independent reviews but are hard to sift through. The word of mouth thing is suboptimal, especially for travelers.

Not yet live: we plan to add “schedules” to the site, so yogis can see at a glance where and when the classes of their favourite teachers will be. This will solve a major pain for millions of yogis who currently have to go to multiple websites to do this.

Proxino (Taazr)
S10
Successful
Uncaught program bugs are expensive, and for this reason, good developers take care in testing their code. However, even the best test suites will not catch all program bugs. Taazr will identify such bugs earlier in the development cycle, and companies will save money that otherwise might have been spent on code maintenance and customer support.

We believe that statistical debugging is uniquely suited to web applications, due to the relative ease with which web apps can be instrumented through lightweight and unobtrusive javascript. While statistical debugging has succeeded in a research context on desktop software, automatically finding bugs in live web applications remains an open industrial problem.

However, our ultimate aim is not just to find bugs in web applications, but also to fix them. This will likely require tighter integration — server-side — between our tools and a developer’s code.

bxblue
S17
Successful
We’ve created (and are improving) an algorithm that analyses one’s paycheck stub and simulates all loans’ opportunities in a matter of seconds, allowing users to easily compare rates among different banks and get it online.

Such algorithm is able to estimate information about each loan, using the paycheck stub data and combining to data found online and define a score value for that client to make an automatic proposal for users in a matter of seconds.This way, the algorithm plays a huge role in giving convenience and also transparency to our users, and also optimizing deals in our pipeline for action.

For clients, without this solution, the only alternative available today is to personally visit different bank branches, bank correspondents or resort to street brokers’ advices, to get some of the information and wait days until the final approval of their loans.

Plus, as users usually get up to 30 payroll-deductible-loans in their lifetime (because they have the opportunity to get money at such a low interest rate), the algorithm will also be able to help them i.) manage their loans; ii.) pay them back faster, if they want to; iii.) reduce their installments whenever the government reference interest rate goes down; and iv.) borrow more money for the best rates available, whenever they need it again.

Pic ur Photo
S19
Unsuccessful
1) Pic ur Photo curates the best hotspots, and the resulting images inspire people. We have customers who have bucket lists of photos they want to get, and others who travel 4 hours to a specific location they saw on our website, or an experience they want to have.

2) There’s no pressure on our shoots (price, convenience), so our customers end up with photos that are natural. A customer might travel across the country or squeeze it into a lunch break.

3) Pic ur Photo is the first platform where you can see the result before buying the photos you want (you, you know…pick ur photo). We require a minimal deposit, but that money goes into a user’s account as a credit.

4) Pic ur Photo is the first platform where you can see a photo in our content and book that location from within the photo. We do that by predicting and scouting the best photo locations.

5) Photographers set their schedule, and users book. No need for communication about availability, location, portfolio, price…a freelance photographer will typically use 5 different services to run their business (think Squarespace, Dropbox, PayPal, WhatsApp, and other social medias, etc..). Our photographers only use one.

6) The customer doesn’t browse different photographers, and there’s no complicated signup process. Customers book whatever photographer is scheduled in the location on the day they book. And, we have a closer relationship with our photographers than other platforms, meaning we fill up the entire schedule they want to work.

On competing platforms, photographers don’t get enough gigs, get bored, and leave. It might look like an active place, but it’s not (usually). All open slots on our platform can be booked and already have a photographer scheduled to handle them.

People resort to using their smartphones. We’ll take customers from the more traditional photo services industry too, but roughly 80% of our customers had never hired a professional photographer before. People use their smartphones, because they’re convenient and the price is negligible. That’s the market we’re aiming for.

Syllble
W18
Unsuccessful
At the core of what we are building is a decentralized production collab team that allows people to create together in a fun way. We are focused on making a structured process where people can collaborate and explore their creativity in an unfettered way both in person and online. We want to charge people to join a CollabRoom group to create with others original content then connect them with the right people to have their finished product (book) distributed to different markets and audiences (readers and filmmakers). We want to cut out the agent and give people an equal footing in having more access to opportunities of getting their work (seen by the right people) out to the world. Through the collabroom we can address many pain points bring them more accountability, structure and time, confidence in growing as a better writer then having a voice and influence to make a difference in the world.

People go on Reddit to collaborate writing. People even go to college and spend four entire years to learn how to write. People sign up for writing workshops to break their writers block. People submit their screenplays and novels in thousands yet just few a few are picked by major publishing companies and certain narratives that impact the world negatively are repeated.

As for established writers who often lack the wealth from the small royalties they receive, we want to connect them together with other published writers through the collabroom through which they can work to meet Businesses needs and create the kind of unique storytelling that can inspire employees and business leadership as a mean to get paid and find the time to write.

We’re the only organisation in the world that uses in-depth research to help people choose careers that make a difference.

Most career advice doesn’t focus on social impact. When it does, it’s based on anecdote rather than research, and usually confined to one narrow approach e.g. just the charity sector. This means it can’t help you with the big decisions that really matter, like PhD vs. startup vs. Teach for America. Instead, when it comes to these decisions, our audience must put together their own makeshift guidance from friends, mentors and family.

Spreadsheet Magic
S14
Unsuccessful
# New things

Compared to traditional programming languages:

* Data is visible at each step of processing and can be manipulated directly

* Easy integration with data sources (similar to Zapier)

* Easy visualisation of data at any step

* Can utilise multiple cores, vectorisations and GPUs efficiently because works on arrays of data and typical shape of data is known during development of “program” and can be used by optimising compiler

Compared to spreadsheets:

* Can be scaled to vast amounts of data

* Allows to input/output data among different data sources / web services

* Is targeted toward general purpose programming

* Allows creating new abstractions (functions)

* Can use simple text-based format to allow use of existing version control systems and diff/merge tools

# Substitutes

- Putting together some combination of spreadsheets and shell scripts.

- Copy-pasting CSV data directly into spreadsheets and then uploading processed data as CSV file to web-services (did it myself to load intercom.io data into Mailchimp). Ok as one-off job, but it often has to be repeated all the time.

- Hiring team of software developers to do expensive custom software for business.

Apptimize
S13
Successful
Most wait for app store approval and push many changes simultaneously. They eyeball the results and haphazardly rollback suspect changes.

Desperate people resort to basic, home-grown solutions. Because of other projects, Switchboard and Clutch.io evolved incomplete solutions (we noticed errors: randomization mistakes that mess up the experiments, poor error handling, malformed responses that’d crash your app!).

There hasn’t been much focused effort towards creating a seamless AB testing experience for native apps. AB testing for mobile is a technologically harder problem than for websites due to challenges particular to mobile devices (ie. intermittent internet, lack of cookies/iframes, users running different versions). Existing solutions ignore complexity whereas we view handling it as our core business.

Trestle
W19
Unsuccessful
Many larger companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe have had to build this in-house, dedicating significant resources to do so and maintain the software. In some cases, this software is built solely during company hackathons and so the end result is often a product that doesn’t provide a cohesive experience, has poor UX, and lacks important features. At smaller companies which are just starting to feel the pain, companies fall back to products such as Slack or HRIS directories which provide only the barest information and lack good search functionality. [redacted], for example, has resorted to using Wordpress as their internal homepage where each employee has a “profile” with their name, picture, and contact info, and there’s a new post every time a new all hands video is posted. This is a clear pain point that companies are facing and I intend to solve that for them.

Bubblin Superbooks
W18
Unsuccessful
What's new—We liberate digital books from hardware. The idea is to have books come alive on web without using proprietary formats or vendor lock-ins. A reader need not own a piece of hardware (like Kindle) to enjoy reading digital books. Meaning freedom, flexibility and share-ability etc for books.

What substitutes exist?—Developers use books published on web more than anything else. The mass market reads on the dead tree while the progressive ones are on Kindle that is now over a decade old. Kids are on the iPad, and that's where we are putting all our focus on.

The fastest growing companies are increasingly non-public and rely on totally different metrics than firms like Bloomberg or Morningstar offer. Today VCs do their own analysis to figure out who the hot firms are, we expect to commoditize some of that.

Standard Treasury
S13
Successful
When most businesses wants to do something financial they have to call their bank and talk to a person - except for getting a MID. That doesn't make sense. Getting a wire, as an example, often involves twenty minutes, a painful conversation, and $30. Even non-quant hedge funds needing to convert EURO to GBP have to pick up the phone and talk to a bank's trading desk.

No one has built developer friendly bank back-end processing, so you have to deal with banks, which overcharge, are slow, and are not developer friendly. Wells Fargo, for example, does offers an API which costs more than their other options and, well, is not very good.

We marry the the advantages of ACH (ubiquitous and affordable) and the advantages of credit cards (fast) and put them both in the same product. Our payment system is therefore fast, secure, and affordable.

Right now people are using credit cards, e-transfers, and checks. Credit cards tell retailers whether or not they are going to get paid for what they are selling. But in order to work, they require an asset-heavy and insecure process that costs merchants in the US alone $50 billion a year.

To the extent innovation has existed, it has been on top of existing credit card networks. Because of these innovations, credit card processing has become faster or more broadly available. But because innovations are on top of an obsolete network, credit card processing has also become more expensive.

Prolific
S19
Successful
"People research" is broken: Finding participants is difficult and slow and with other platforms data is biased, low quality, and incentives are misaligned. Researchers want participants and data they can trust, but they resort to platforms which provide disengaged people who signup for pennies, fraudsters and bots, leaving them crying out for higher quality solutions.

We're tackling this by obsessing about trust, data quality, and "truth". We use proprietary user validation, statistical algorithms and machine learning to weed out bots and bad actors which plague the rest. Competitors have no minimum pay policies and often pay next to nothing to their participants leading to misalignment, disengagement and bias or fraud. We have a variety of incentives built in to our platform including pre-qualification for studies, two-way feedback, and guaranteed minimum pay. In addition, researchers can transparently explore the marketplace and get in touch with participants directly. As a result, both sides of the marketplace trust our platform, which means that participants provide high quality data and researchers conduct high quality research.

Our platform also creates virtuous cycles for our community. Demand from researchers attracts further participants to our platform. We leverage our increased supply of participants to innovate, for example enabling researchers to collect nationally representative samples at the click of a button! This virtuous cycle powers our growth. At the moment, many use non-dedicated solutions like Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), which were not developed to solve these problems, and as a result suffer from poor quality and limited feature innovation.

Streamplate
W21
Unsuccessful
Streamplate’s food ordering app is a collection of services to support the broad spectrum of user types given everyone eats and drinks. The logic here is that to become the last food ordering app, we have to be able to support a range of interactions that people have with food/drink outlets. This means not just supporting different ways of ordering, but also showing as many venues as possible.

Our app allows users to pre-order, order from their table, split bills via Bluetooth, create a health tracking dashboard with widgets, reserve and message venues, earn money by curating venues/menus, creating events (eg. market stalls, fundraisers etc) and serving meals from a user’s home.

We also allow order-forwarding which means that when a user orders from a venue that isn’t connected to Streamplate, we forward the order onto a pre-existing service that is with that venue, eg. UberEats or DoorDash.

This also means we allow delivery without having to worry about the overhead of managing a fleet.

Our feature list highlights how Streamplate is an aggregation of a range of pre-existing services, allows users to monetise their eating/drinking experiences and our focus on web-scraping/automating, means we’re looking to be globally accessible from day 1.

– I think everything is new, there is no platform in Spanish with courses in basic and applied sciences. The ones that exist offer a segment of what we want to offer and don’t care about creating a community or in the social learning experience.

– YouTube works for basic knowledge, but when the knowledge becomes more specialized, you only have what the university gives you.

We are making new AI models that enable low-cost devices to analyze videos on the device itself, thus eliminating the need for relying on Google and Amazon cloud intelligence or investing money in costly computer hardware. Our AI models can run 62x faster than the current state of the art methods.

In the security space, the video is analyzed only post an incident. Which today is done by humans. ‘Netatmo Presence’ is a security camera that can classify objects such as people, car, and animals in a video.

Recently, Amazon announced ‘Deep Lens’ video camera which is also able to “classify” live video feed and they are targeting it at developers. It is a step in the right direction.

However, we must mention that image classification is not the same as object detection and is at least 20x less computationally expensive.

Plus, there are IP cameras in the market from Nest, Blink, Hikvision that can detect motion and then trigger a notification to the owner. However, it cannot differentiate between a motion caused by innocuous objects, such as pets, and intruders.

People are overwhelmed with information and stuck in "google doc hell" - the condition caused through tools that make it easy to create new notes but difficult to find existing notes. By storing notes in hierarchies and using lookup to reference them, users can find any particular note in seconds even if they have thousands of notes. Just as important, if a user is unable to find a note using lookup, they can be confident that the note doesn't exist. While the concepts of hierarchies are not new, hierarchies have never been used to their full potential in note taking tools. This is because the tooling around them sucks. All note taking tools (and even your file system), supports hierarchies. But besides holding your notes, these hierarchies do nothing but get in your way. You can't use them to find notes. They are difficult to change. They add friction to creating new notes. Dendron gives you all the good parts of hierarchies and takes away the friction.

We take the engineering out of building an online trade school so educators can focus teaching their craft. Our tool streamlines the administrative side of running an online trade school by creating an all-in-one solution for admissions, payment processing, live conferencing, and student management.

Content creators are hacking together a few different tools to replicate this experience on their own: Zoom, Calendly, Facebook groups, Google forms, etc..

Companies like Lambda School, Flockjay, and Jumpcut are building these tools from scratch which requires a tremendous amount of engineering effort.

Soon anybody and any organization, not just venture-backed startups, will be able to start risk-free online trade school. Yay!

1) It costs at least an order of magnitude less than what is being built today.
2) It's designed to work on existing cars.

Americans drive 37 miles per day on average. They sometimes drive while texting, drive while intoxicated, or simply drive while being distracted. People seem to be trying really hard to do other things instead of driving, but so far there aren't many good ways to accomplish this.

Some newer vehicles have advanced cruise control systems that keep the vehicle in the lane during ideal highway driving situations, but drivers aren't supposed to do anything else or even take their eyes off the road. This seems like a band‑aid solution.

Automated CS courses are not new, online coding schools such as Code School and Code Academy have had them for awhile now. What is unique about our platform is that it supports core programming languages such as Java, C, and C# in addition to the web based languages that others support. Also our platform is built to be integrated into schools as classroom courses rather than for individuals to casually learn online. And finally we base all of our algorithms off of machine learning so as we process more and more data, our plagiarism detection system and analytics reports will just keep getting smarter.

Right now, the way a high school starts a CS program is to hire a qualified instructor, have them develop course content based on his or her understanding, and then start teaching. Through interviews with some high school administrators we have come to determine that the average cost for this is around 70k a year. This price point of this in addition to the lack of qualified instructors is what has been stopping High Schools from starting their own CS programs.

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
Task Pigeon augments our task management application with an on-demand marketplace of freelancers.

Why is that important? Well, firstly, existing task management / project management tools are all essentially focused on helping you and your team write things down. They are essentially just a better, more digitized version of pen and paper.

What they all ignore is the underlying issue. That is that, up to 40% of tasks people add to their to do list are never actually completed. So how do you solve that?

The answer is Task Pigeon. For example, let’s say Sarah assigns John a task to complete by Friday, but John’s week ends up getting overloaded with more urgent work. Currently this team would face two options. 1) Delay the task to next week or 2) cancel the task altogether. Task Pigeon introduces a third option and allows you to outsource that task in just a few clicks.

What substitutes exist currently? To achieve this you/your team would first need a task management application. Here our competitors are the likes of Trello, Asana, Monday.com, Wrike and Basecamp. Secondly, you would need to find a platform that allows you to find and source freelancers. Here the two most common options with be Upwork and Freelancer.

The problem with both of these outsourcing platforms is that you have to a) create a job b) wade through ten’s of submissions c) shortlist candidates d) select a candidate e) assign them the job. It all takes so much time. Time that you are not going to bother spending if the task was a 500 word blog post or some internet based research.

Task Pigeon removes all that friction. There is now searching for freelancers, no haggling over the price. Everything is predetermined. You just select the task you want to outsource and we take care of the rest.

What’s new about FLEX:

The distribution channel (e-commerce, direct to consumer, subscription)
Chic design, high-end packaging, differentiated branding and unique millennial voice
Product features (fit/materials)
It can be worn up to 12 hours and it is not linked to TSS
23% more sex; it allows a user and their partner to engage in mess-free intercourse (and if her partner is male, he won’t feel much, if anything)
Environmental impact (fewer changes, less packaging and waste)
This market is extremely underserved; women who don’t want to use tampons or pads have very few options other than menstrual cups.

There’s are a couple of important differences between FLEX and menstrual cups. Menstrual cups block the vaginal canal (don’t allow sex), they fill up and must be rinsed and reused. This makes for an awkward experience at work or in a public restroom. Menstrual cups are also difficult to insert (there are four different ways you can fold it before inserting) and remove (mine got stuck), which are huge barriers to adoption. Finally, menstrual cups are reused for 5–10 years, and this is a huge behavior change from disposing tampons. FLEX is disposable and addresses this important concern.

In contract to Headspace and Calm who have launched a single 'channel,' we're launching a marketplace — a platform for mindfulness, offering a continuously updated stream of meditation content from a variety of teachers.

We're the first to create a meditation platform that curates content from hundreds of high-quality mindfulness professionals and charge subscriptions for access.

We're also the first to introduce a Spotify-like business model to the meditation space. Mindfulness teachers are paid a portion of our subscription revenue commensurate to the number of times their content is listened to. Users get access to meditation content that is diverse in personality and topics.

Silent retreats and in-person meditation studios are other alternatives, but they aren't accessible to all busy working professionals financially or temporally.

At OpenPhone, we are bridging the gap between a phone system and a CRM.

A lot of small business owners rely on a phone system to communicate with their customers. Right now, 86% of them are using their personal phone numbers for business which is both limiting and problematic on so many levels.

Majority of small businesses don’t use a CRM because existing solutions put the burden of data entry on the user. Who’s got time for that?

We change that by owning the communication channel between businesses and their customers. This means that we can help small businesses stay on top of their customer relationships and ultimately close more deals.

We’re also going to help them identify and track their conversion funnels — the paths visitors take to registrations, purchases or any other goal page designated by the company.

We offer the a better way of collaborating on digital products ( the feature branch workflow) to organizations that prefer to work on open source tools. Open source is interesting for large companies because they can inspect and modify the code. They also can and do contribute back changes that are important to them. Substitutes are closed source alternatives (GitHub Enterprise, Atlassian Stash) or less functional open source alternatives (Gitorious, Gogs). GitHub currently has a lot of mind-share but they are under- serving the on-premises (behind the firewall) market. We can see us grow into the leading solution for those installations (which is currently the majority of the market). In the long run most software will live on some (hybrid-)cloud and we think there are many ways to differentiate our offering (open source/distributed/integrated). In the short term we are emulating the Netflix strategy, shipping DVD’s (focus on the on-premise installations) when the competitors focus on the video-on-demand (SaaS) offering.

Dropbox
S07
Successful
Most small teams have a few basic needs: (1) team members need their important stuff in front of them wherever they are, (2) everyone needs to be working on the latest version of a given document (and ideally can track what's changed), (3) and team data needs to be protected from disaster. There are sync tools (e.g. beinsync, Foldershare), there are backup tools (Carbonite, Mozy), and there are web uploading/publishing tools (box.net, etc.), but there's no good integrated solution.

Dropbox solves all these needs, and doesn't need configuration or babysitting. Put another way, it takes concepts that are proven winners from the dev community (version control, changelogs/trac, rsync, etc.) and puts them in a package that my little sister can figure out (she uses Dropbox to keep track of her high school term papers, and doesn't need to burn CDs or carry USB sticks anymore.)

At a higher level, online storage and local disks are big and cheap. But the internet links in between have been and will continue to be slow in comparison. In "the future", you won't have to move your data around manually. The concept that I'm most excited about is that the core technology in Dropbox -- continuous efficient sync with compression and binary diffs -- is what will get us there.

Competitors line up in two categories: marketing focused, such as Iterable (https://iterable.com/), and engineer focused, such as Twilio Notify. Iterable is easily the most robust competitor in this space, but is focused on a different buyer persona and thus a different set of features. With the acquisition of SendGrid, I expect Twilio to re-invest in this space in the future - currently Twilio Notify is not a compelling product. I still expect whatever solution Twilio brings to market to be Twilio+SendGrid-centric rather than open to many providers, but given their dominance in both of those respective channels, they're certainly who I fear the most.

Simula
S18
Unsuccessful
What we fear the most: bad timing/VR Winter. In 2017, VR failed to meet the industry’s growth expectations, suggesting it has not reached its moment of ascension on the hype cycle curve. This could require the founders to survive a “VR Winter” by staying lean and keeping the project alive long enough to be around when VR takes off (that, or try to be the reason VR takes off: providing the killer use case that the rest of the industry was missing). We have been handling this by finding clever ways to fund the project internally (see our answer to “If you’ve applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made…?”)

Other risk factors:

- Explicit competition. Microsoft Holographic is providing the well-polished, proprietary VR OS in the Windows ecosystem; meanwhile, other VR Desktop startups (BigScreen) are based in the MS ecosystem. In addition, some headset manufacturers appear to be making their own VR OS’s internally (i.e., Magic Leap), but haven’t actually released anything. Other than this, nobody is explicitly targeting Linux Desktop users like we are, primarily because it is such a small market (1%-2% of all PC desktops run Linux).
- Implicit competition. We also fear that Valve’s SteamVR could organically evolve into a viable VR desktop environment (to the surprise of people who think of it primarily as a gaming/entertainment platform). The same holds for Google Daydream or Oculus.
- Headset Friction. The friction of having to mount and unmount an HMD just to access your OS might prohibit VR Desktops from taking off.
- Lack of Open-Source Durability. Open source projects are easily forkable. Simula lacks long-term durability until it can find a way to protect itself from other competition.
- Poor Text Resolution. You can’t spend 16 hours a day in VR Desktop if the text resolution is poor. Industry improvements to GPUs and HMDs might solve this for us, but if it doesn’t there might be other techniques (vector-based 3D text rendering) that we can try.

DuoLingo, Babbel, Busuu, RosettaStone, Chatterbug and Anki are some of my name brand competitors. We are in the same market but our approaches are so different we won’t directly compete.

Even though DuoLingo has become the first $1Bn company in the market there is no market leader. The top 15 language learning apps only have 42% market share. It’s a free-for-all until someone achieves product-market fit. And as mentioned previously there is no one that targets intermediate and advanced language learners.

LingQ is my closest competitor. They started with learning vocabulary from native books and articles. But I don’t fear them, they’ve been around since 2007 and seem content being a niche product. Also, I feel like they launched too early when the content and technology was lacking. Which led to them continuously adding “me too” features. In the end making them look like every other language learning app plus a small gimmick.

Voxy is the company I fear most; they are solidly executing on the principles I am aiming for. If they were to drastically change their target market it could be troublesome but for institutional and corporate English as a second language (ESL). Fortunately their chief educational officer is completely dismissive of independent language learning and student choice.

That said, other fact checking websites will be our main competitors such as Snopes (http://www.snopes.com/) and PolitiFact. Otherwise, as Google and Facebook begin to roll out their own solutions these will be internal solutions to problems faced by the all media services on the internet.

LinkedIn will always be a fearsome player in the recruiting space, but its approach and interface will always leave room for other players in the space. The Ladders is another likely competitor, though we believe they are limited by the banker­-esque brand they've created and the fact that many young professionals do not solely define themselves by the ability to make over a certain salary; more and more, individuals are drawn to tech start­ups or global development in addition to, say, corporate strategy.

On the media end, Marie Claire is moving sharply in our direction (professional women, career content) but because of its strategy and the limitations of its mass-­market, print-­focused model, it is likely to become more of an ally than a competitor. We are in frequent touch with Marie Claire's publishers to talk about how we can work together.

My most direct competitor is Names and Faces, a YC company from the last batch, who is catering to the same customer base building out a simple employee directory. While they have a great UX, they have only the most basic information about employees: their name, picture, contact info, department, role, and office. They also lack any company information.

The competitor that I fear most are the variety of HRIS services that many companies already use such as Namely and Workday. They already have a huge customer base and offer a directory service. However, currently they suffer from a few problems: they generally have extremely poor UX, employees view them as mainly a place to update their payroll, view benefits, etc. not a place to connect/collaborate, and they also only show basic information about employees. If they decided to invest more effort into better UX and features, they would be a significant threat.

Lastly, Stripe could be a possible competitor in the future. They wrote a blog post about Stripe Home which got a significant amount of attention and their product has a good enough UX and features that I believe that it would succeed. They are also well respected in the startup community and also have a large customer base that they could sell to. However, as far as I know, they currently have no plans to productize Stripe Home and sell it to other companies.

We're super careful about pitching against Kindle but our readers swear by the experience we bring to the table. A great community will help us differentiate in the long run.

Commercial banking broadly - including every service we're imagining other than ACH (F/X, Wires, Factoring, Lending, Account Creation/Deletion, etc) - is not something that the innovative payments companies plan to provide to others, although they're all services they, themselves, need. Stripe, for example, is trying to make payments work on the web. We're trying to make commercial banking work in the world. They're both trillion dollar problems, but they're different.

We do worry about Square and PayPal. If they wanted to cannibalized their main revenue source in credit card processing, they could take us out. But that’s a difficult business decision for either of them to make.

As we’re looking to forward delivery orders this by-passes the typical competitor that would be the well-capitalised companies like UberEats, Deliveroo, DoorDash, GrubHub etc.

But, as we’re not relying on delivery as being part of our revenue stream, we see our primary competition being other platforms; namely Facebook, Google and Amazon. These platforms have the capital, reach and ability to similarly consolidate services.

This will realistically always be a threat. However, I think Streamplate’s goal of showing users what they want rather than interlacing that with ads, or other services (eg. embedding reservations in Google Maps) will mean that we have a philosophy to guide us away from the tactics and strategies that may be employed against us.

– The big ones that have courses about almost everything: Udemy, EdX, Coursera.

– Other competitors: TareasPlus, KhanAcademy, Mayugo, aprendiendo.la, among others.

– The bulk of our competitors: Institutes, universities and consultancies with education programs mostly live and at high prices.

– What I fear most is the one who may become a competitor: Platzi, a technology education platform. Although the physics and calculus courses that they have on their platform could have been produced to help science divulgators or as a marketing strategy, they could be a great competitor if they get into other areas of science.

Learn Venue

Unsuccessful
Our direct competitor is XNOR.AI. It is a startup based out of Netherlands. We both share similar technology and vision to make the device intelligent rather than the cloud. Google and Amazon Cloud video intelligence also pose a threat indirectly. There is always a chance that Google tries to venture into on-device intelligence. However, we believe that it will be against their established infrastructure and services around cloud intelligence. But we do fear this the most.

Dendron
W21
Successful
I divide competition into two groups: established and upcoming.

Established competitors are Notion and Roam. These tools all provide a better take on knowledge management and have significant traction and funding with their current user base.

Upcoming competitors are Obsidian, Logseq and Foam. These tools are all free and attract a similar customer base as Dendron.

At this point, no competitor offers the equivalent of Dendron's hierarchal features. My greatest fear and hope, is that they do. Using hierarchies to manage notes goes against what is currently trendy (eg. structureless approach to note taking). Half the battle right now is convincing people to give Dendron a shot because of our focus on hierarchies (once they do, they end up sticking with it). If more tools adopt hierarchies, it'll lower the friction for people to adopt Dendron. If we end up in a world where we compete on hierarchical features, not only will Dendron have a headstart but it will also have significant mindshare in pioneering the new trend.

We’re not seeing majors players in this space, but companies that are most equipped to take on this space:

Mighty Networks

We fear Teachable the most due to their access to a rich pool of online creators.

It’s important to note here that online courses don’t cut it for career-changing education.

Cruise

Google currently has the most impressive self‑driving cars. Elon Musk has announced Tesla's plans to have cars that drive 90% of the time in 3 years. Most major auto manufacturers have already demonstrated self‑driving R&D prototypes and have partnered with various universities. OEM's like Bosch and Continental have large teams working on self‑driving technology that could end up in future generations of new cars.

We are most afraid of Google. Their systems potentially have access to Streetview and Maps data, which is extremely hard to replicate. Their current technology is too expensive to sell directly to consumers, and their commercialization strategy is unclear, but those things could change very quickly.

Mimir
S15
Successful
Our competitors are organizations such as CodeHS and Code.org that are offering course content for instructors to use in their courses. The problem with them is that they only provide that content and still require schools to hire a qualified CS instructor to teach the material and handle the assignments unlike our platform.
But by far, our biggest fear is Google. Google is continuously making a push for expanding CS education. They have released a vast amount of resources to help teachers better their current CS courses. They have yet to introduce a pre-builts CS program that can be deployed into school but it is certainly something we can see them doing. We plan building Mimir to the point we become an acquisition target for them.

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
On the task management from Trello, Asana, Monday.com, Basecamp, etc would be our largest competitors. Interestingly enough some user research we conducted highlighted that people outside of the tech ecosystem haven’t heard of these platforms as often as you would think. Therefore I don’t believe any one player has achieved a dominating position in the market.

On the outsource/freelancer front platforms such as Freelancer.com and Upwork are out main competitors for general tasks. There are also other platforms that offer freelancers for a more defined scope such as blog writing (i.e. iWriter) ,marketing (CloudPeeps) or general virtual assistants (i.e. People Per Hour), etc, but again that requires going out of your existing task management tool and into another in order to find and source someone appropriate to complete the work for you.

In terms of who I fear most it would be a well funded company such as Asana or Trello (acquired by Atlassian) deploying additional resources to build out a marketplace of their own. Alternatively, I see Upwork as the most dominant player on the freelancer side and they could either build or acquire a task management application that they integrate closely with their marketplace.

Our competitors include large consumer goods companies and menstrual cup manufacturers.

We fear large consumer goods companies most: P&G (Tampax, Always), Kimberly-Clark (Kotex), Playtex Products, Energizer (o.b., Stayfree, Always). They have significant resources and channel relationships, but they also lack a standout brand; they don’t have a voice that resonates with millennials.

Softcup is another competitor* to watch because their product design is most similar to ours. Their awareness is very low, our brand is highly differentiated, and we’ve created an entirely different distribution strategy (direct to consumer, subscription-based with higher margins than traditional retailers).

Major menstrual cup manufacturers are competitors (DivaCup, Lunette) because they share many of the same benefits of our product and they have been in the market since the early 2000’s.

Finally, startups like white-labeled tampon subscription companies (LOLA, Cora) and absorbable period panties (THiNX, Dear Kate) are gaining momentum with millennials. The products aren’t new, but they have brands that engage millennials.

Not Google or Yahoo. They've both tried to partner with newspapers, and never thought big enough. Facebook is a definite possibility: their biggest growth right now is coming from baby boomers. Thankfully Facebook hasn't figured out how a local online community should look, as they seem to think that business information should be displayed in the same way as profile information.

Like many YC applicants, we're most worried about other start-ups. Right now there are other start-ups working on this problem -- and they're not married, have no social life, and have been doing it for a lot longer.

OpenPhone
S18
Successful
There are traditional cloud phone systems that have captured 14% of the market. Google Voice, Sideline, Grasshopper, Phone.com to name a few.

These solutions are outdated, not maintained or barely updated, and compete on phone system features and pricing. They do offer a second phone line for business but outside of that, they are not solving enough problems.More modern phone systems like Dialpad are focused on larger businesses with different needs.

Communication products that offer CRM-like capabilities like Front, Intercom, Drift, and so on are primarily focused on email and live chat as their core channels. For our target market, live chat is not a channel they use and they are happy with Gmail as their email client.

Products like Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and iMessage are offering their own business solutions and what they are doing is fragmenting the communication space even more and forcing small businesses to be active on many channels. This gives us the opportunity to integrate with all these channels and create a unified place for all business communications.

None of the existing players we named here can simply add a phone system or CRM to their product to compete with us.

Building a phone system first CRM is not an afterthought, it impacts every decision in the product.

I think our biggest competitor is some unknown startup building towards the same vision as us somewhere in the world right now.

Mixpanel

Our primary competitor is Google Analytics. Many of the inquiries we receive ask “How are you different from GA?” and a successful solution has been to explicitly say what we offer and how we are different from the beginning. We fear Google the most because of their market penetration and their engineering resources.

Aside from Google, there are a few other companies entering this market: nuconomy, KISSmetrics, Aster Data, and Gumtrail.

Paystack
W16
Successful
We have 3 types of competitors: (1) Local Financial Institutions (2) Global Payment cos and (3) Local non-Financial Institutions

Local FI’s are not able to progress because they mostly buy white label solutions. No incremental progress or problem-solving.

Global companies like Stripe and Braintree are competitors but it will be difficult for them to meet the needs of the African Merchants. It’s easy for them to offer Bitcoin or Apple Pay integration but what about Verve Cards (a pan African card scheme), or Mobile Money or other local card schemes?

Local Non FI’s are the real competition, but we believe that as long as we focus on solving the merchant’s needs we will continue to grow our business.

– At the moment our competitors are the applications named above. In addition there are 3 more application, which are more closer to the nature of Buffer. They are Timely, Pluggio and 14blocks.

– Losing our focus on what the customer needs and focusing on whom we fear most is what we fear most.

GitLab
W15
Successful
GitHub Enterprise and Atlassian Stash are our primary competitors. We fear Atlassian Stash most since the GitHub Enterprise offering is weak (black box VM that doesn’t scale or cluster) and overpriced (4x more expensive than Stash or our standard subscription). We compete with Stash on usability, integration (no need to install Jira and Confluence separately), flexibility (you can inspect and adapt the source) and price.

Carbonite and Mozy do a good job with hassle-free backup, and a move into sync would make sense. Sharpcast (venture funded) announced a similar app called Hummingbird, but according to Jeff (who is good friends with the tech lead) they're taking an extraordinarily difficult approach involving NT kernel drivers. Google's coming out with GDrive at some point. Microsoft's Groove does sync and is part of Office 2007, but is very heavyweight and doesn't include any of the web stuff or backup. There are apps like Omnidrive and Titanize but the implementations are buggy or have bad UIs.

Q: What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

The applicability of the Segment or Stripe playbooks of locking in new startups while they're young and looking for an easy implementation-path and then scaling revenue commensurately as their revenue grows is huge, and is different from the martech playbook competitors like Iterable are running. This playbook requires targeting engineers looking for fast solutions to common early problems as well as features that let you scale pricing and penetration within those customers as they themselves grow.

Parobyte Technologies
Unsuccessful
- For 85% of all procurement, the corner stores would check with all the suppliers - Open Market Distributors, Udaan, Amazon Business, Flipkart Wholesale etc before making the order. The procurement decision is then made by the retailers after considering just one factor – who gives lowest price? There is almost zero loyalty for retailers to any supplier here.

- The remaining 15% procurement kicks in, when there is a stockout. For this, stores do either of below:
Roughly ~50% Corner Store owners rush to a nearby wholesale markets to get the products in cash.
And the remaining half decide to suffer sales loss for next 2 days. They make an order in any of the apps/distributors and get the orders in due time albeit suffering the loss in sales (and more importantly customer satisfaction) in the interim period.

- The procurement decision for this “15%” is unique. Retailers are willing to go through the inconvenience, pay in cash for the order and in a few cases willing to pay a small premium for some products. Almost all the companies focus on “85%” market and there is no one that is solving the “15%” problem.

- This “15%” procurement is done for FMCG products. These products have relatively higher margin compared to commodities (sacks of rice, sugar, wheat etc) that retailers plan and purchase.

- The order size of B2C consumer delivery apps such as Instamart (of Swiggy), Flipkart Quick and Amazon Fresh is ~ $6. Our AOV is ~ $65 that could be achieved at the same SKU collection in the warehouse and fulfilled at almost the same delivery expense. And there is more opportunity to become a sole supplier of our valuable customers in due time.

In an ideal world, everyone would use our API from day one and skip building email notifications entirely. However, today, most companies have already invested in their email notifications and are reluctant to switch to a new API. We find that it's vital not to underestimate this inertia. To help them migrate to MagicBell, without writing any code to talk to our API, we let them bcc their existing email notifications to us and embed our notification center in their product. This setup takes less than 30 mins. Over time they can start using the API to build new notifications. This quick and low-risk way of delivering value to their users significantly reduces the friction of adoption.

We think most people in the space don’t understand how overlooked DS tooling is and that if you capture the DS notebook (home for Data Scientist/ML Engineer), you can expand easily into other areas of the data and ML pipelines. There’s a ton of focus on DevTools for devs, not much on tools for pseudo-devs (DSs) -- we think this is a pretty big opportunity that we can go after.

Simula
S18
Unsuccessful
Our idea follows from 3 contrarian beliefs:

(T1) Most people think that the future of VR is in games and entertainment, but it is also in office work; in particular, VR is going to replace screens and laptops.

Because of (T1), the VR industry is too biased towards Windows (where PC games are deployed). Ours is based on Linux (small and overlooked starting point). It’s not focused on video games or entertainment experiences (SteamVR, Daydream, Oculus), but on “boring”, 2D work applications.

(T2) Most people think that VR is about single-purpose 3D applications, but VR is just as much about multi-purpose 2D applications.

Simula aims to let 2D and 3D apps reside and communicate with each other in a single shared workspace (see our prototype). Contrast this with existing VR applications (like Tilt Brush), which run once at a time.

(T3) Most people think that VR should be optimized for terrain and video display, but VR should also be optimized for clear text resolution.

Clear text resolution is a requirement for VR to become a viable work platform: people must be able to read code, spreadsheets, and information with 100% clarity in order for VR to be truly 10x better than physical screens.

Athlete profiles are the most important feature because it interests the largest amount of parties and the data collected from a large number of profiles can be valuable to many people. Perfecting profiles can bring in money from coaches (for converting to a full team site), parents (for recruiting exposure), and recruiters (for access to search the data). As students and athletes, we get the user's point of view: they want a beautiful page of basic stats that they can show to recruiters and look professional. As a 3-sport athlete in high school, and a 2-sport D1 varsity athlete in college, I would have wanted this product for myself. So we're building it now.

The gold standard for learning a language would be to have a full-time personal language tutor constantly with you as you lived in the language. This person would not translate for you, they would give you the minimum amount of new information needed to understand the situation and respond accordingly. They would also constantly put you in situations to use things you’ve already learned or review them with you based on detailed notes of what you’ve been taught. Only on very rare occasions would they sit down with you and give you a traditional lecture, analyze sentences or discuss grammar. Sound familiar? That’s exactly what parents do, excluding explicitly tracking your progress.

Instead you are taught in large classes a few times a week where a generic textbook is used to teach you topics that SHOULD be useful to a large number of people while learning the words that SHOULD come up during those topics. No consideration is given to you or your goals. Even worse, in order to maintain order lockstep progression you are actively discouraged from deviating from the syllabus.

It is impossible to explicitly teach everything needed to learn a language. Similarly fluency isn’t a single concept. A perfect demonstration of this is Wired’s 5 levels series of videos where an expert explains a concept from their field to five different audiences ranging from elementary school students to graduate students in their field. My fluency in English doesn’t extend to technical conversations between surgeons, or even plumbers. I simply wouldn’t have the background needed.

Instead I believe that thoroughly understanding authentic native media, such as articles, books, songs, etc, in context and in their entirety is the best way to develop these topical fluencies. It has the added advantage of becoming a concrete and objectively meaningful achievement afterwards. As opposed to language classes and apps where the only goal is to “learn the language” and the only achievements possible are subjective fluency tests.

The internet, the current Kpop boom, the anime boom of the 90’s and 00’s, and Netflix have expanded access to authentic foreign language materials such as books, shows, games, forums, etc. so much that it should be possible to teach yourself a language with support and guidance.

Our competitors and the experts in the field focus too much attention on the differences between each company’s fulfillment operations. For our first account, it took over 200 phone calls and 10 days to get a handful of quotes. Most facilities refuse to work with startups due to inconsistent volumes. We found by aggregating products under a major account, providing a standard procedure, and packaging requirements, we eliminated 80% of the fulfillment differences. There will still be custom operations which will be beyond our scope but most startups have similar requirements and dimensional-weights for their products.

Or, how well a certain political statement goes over with a constituency? Or, what sort of language might you look out for when flagging something as potentially fake? Currently with some sort of human touch these sorts of questions can be answered but it might take a bit of time while doing so. We’re attempting to help narrow into the credible pieces.

People. If other coding education companies really understood people and their motivations, they would never start by introducing variables and data types. In its FIRST LESSON on Ruby, Codecademy explains that Ruby is "Interpreted", "Object-oriented", and "allows users to manipulate data structures". Are you kidding me?!

People are lazy and get frustrated or bored quickly. They want to learn how to code because they want to build something and they can't find anyone to do it for them.

Other companies focus solely on developing code fluency. I'm not saying there isn't a market for developing fluency in code, but the market for helping non-technical people quickly get their own web apps live is much, much bigger and largely unaddressed.

While developing iOS games has a fairly low barrier to entry, there is a high
barrier to success. As Ashu experienced himself, it was intimidating as a lone developer to spend money on art or marketing for Helicopter. Additionally, once you begin working in a team with 1,2,3 other people, legal issues and other complexities arise. We hope to reduce the friction involved in collaborative creation.

What others do not realize is that there are throngs of talented people capable and willing to create high quality games but are intimidated by the process. By creating a community of game creators who use us to meet other talented collaborators and publish games, we can in essence uncover latent talent who currently have no clear route to success

Buying and selling luxury goods online is very unique -- security, trust, and risk mitigation are tantamount. The process requires more care than a “general online auction listing.” EBay suffers from numerous issues: counterfeit items, inaccurate descriptions, insufficient photo evidence, photos culled from the net, reused photos from old listings, etc. These frequently lead to PayPal disputes -- which negatively impact everyone involved. Our system solves all of these problems. Of the 200 transactions on the test blog, we had fewer than 1% result in disputes (one out of 200!). Our system easily resolved this dispute: it provided the photographic (and temporal) evidence of the item’s pre-sale condition, expert testimony about its authenticity, and a baseline for comparison with the buyer’s received item. Collectively, these things make our process safer and more comfortable for all parties.

YogaTrail
S14
Unsuccessful
Many things, but first and foremost: the yoga community is a unique crowd, partly because of their diversity (ranging from hippies seeking enlightenment in remote Ashrams to high powered executives that use yoga to de-stress during lunch), and partly because of its general distrust of business and corporations.

The yoga market is peculiar because it’s grown to become a $20B/year industry in a world where words like “money” and “profit” can be dirty words, due to the spiritual and holistic lifestyle aspects that are associated with yoga. We've been very careful to appeal to the entire spectrum of yogis, and YogaTrail has been very well received to date.

Secondly: yoga professionals are organised into a vast network of independent operators (the teachers) who are loosely attached to studios (local) and yoga retreats (exotic and far away). Our site and database structure is built around that idea, and we have viral invite loops that exploit this social landscape.

Thirdly: community-based directories are a lot of work.

Writing code is much like putting words to paper, an act of creation.

Users’ lifetime value is HUGE, as they usually get up to 30 payroll deductible loan in their life.

However, banks, correspondent banks and brokers treat users in a transactional manner, always looking for gaps to profit more, regardless of their users needs. Their operation is focused on their monthly sales target and they lack the culture of recurrence.

Our business, on the other hand, is based on recurrence. We believe in using transparency and convenience to help users empower themselves to make the best decisions regarding their loans, winning their trust in the long run. Even more, we understand that by giving them advice on how to wisely manage their loans (refinancing, lowering their interest rates, paying it back in advance) they will stay with us through their lifetime, rising their LTV while lowering their customer acquisition cost.

Pic ur Photo
S19
Unsuccessful
The problem with other platforms (like Snappr):

We’re not under the delusion that Pic ur Photo is the only company starting in the photography space, but we believe we’ll be the big player in the long run. Those other platforms don’t understand that no one wants to pay $59 for 1 Tinder profile image, no one needs to spend 2 hours on a portrait shoot (and *only* end up with portraits), and people feel cheated when they’re forced to pay extra for high res images–we know, because we asked them..and our data doesn’t lie.

The problem with freelance photographers:

They set minimum booking times, weird rules, like “you get x number of photos or y number of outfit changes,” and “social media license vs full license”. It’s not more difficult or expensive to offer a full license or more photos, so it comes off as disingenuous, especially when they don’t get to pick which photos are the ones they get. Frankly, the whole thing confuses customers, and puts them off hiring a photographer to begin with. Photographers can also be quite pompous about their “art”, not realizing that their end game may be different than the person who hired them.

Freelancers and platforms set these rules, because they have to earn enough to make it worth their time. There’s a lot more that goes into photography than just taking pictures: finding customers, communicating, negotiating, editing photos, & traveling. Imagine traveling 2.5 hours, round-trip across the city for a 1 hour shoot. Photographers do it on a regular basis, and it’s crazy. An average photographer only spends about 7% of their time taking photos, while our photographers spend about 70%, and that’s why we can charge less while earning more.

Because of all this, would-be customers resort to smartphones. People in the photo services industry have enormously underestimated how important convenience and price have become in the smartphone era, where “good enough” photos are in your pocket.

Spreadsheet Magic
S14
Unsuccessful
Visual programming tools visualise the wrong thing – program structure, instead of visualising what is actually important – data.

Existing spreadsheet system don’t make it easy to get data in and out (without manually copy-pasting). One needs to be able to get data from web API and visualise, save to DB or post it to another API without resorting to writing VBA code. It should be easy to do, like Zapier.

Existing spreadsheets don’t allow you to create new abstractions in a natural way. Users should be able to define new functions using just a “sheet” in a spreadsheet, not by writing VBA code.

Neither existing visual programming tools nor spreadsheet systems are friendly to programmers, i.e. no good integration with version control, diffs, etc. This can be solved by simply storing as much as possible in simple human readable text-based format (and using regular version control / diff / merge tools).

Apptimize
S13
Successful
Our competitors are developers building for other developers, so most only offer programmatic interfaces. We understand often the goal setters and decision makers aren’t programmers. Apptimize makes it simple for non-technical owners, product managers, designers, and marketers via a WYSIWYG interface and a website to control and create experiments.

Our experimental setup, results, and analysis will be superior. Stanford PhD’s helped with our statistics by pointing out problems with competitors’ setups (ie. fixed sample sizes, small data set handling).

We’ll target companies who don’t monetize through app sales, instead using apps for branding, coupons, other off-app conversions. Although our first users are indie developers, most profitable apps make <$2K per month, so we’ll grow to targeting corporations like United, Starbucks.

There’s a lot more to build here than a simple directory. Every HRIS system has some variation of name, picture, role, contact info, and org chart but what organizations are really trying to solve is a collaboration problem. Magic happens inside of companies when the right people get in a room together to discuss the right thing. It’s significantly better to be able to find out the right expert to talk to when you’re struggling on a task, or to make sure you’re talking to the right person before you book a meeting with them. Knowing a little bit more information about a person such as a short bio or interests or that their birthday is today can help you connect with them better when you message them on Slack or during meetings. Having a central repository for all of this information plus crucial company information such as important resources and events can create a minimally distracting destination for employees to easily understand what’s going on in the company.

Relationship Hero (WittyThumbs)

Other companies in our industry have either not recognized the new problem modern daters are facing or aren’t trying to fix it on a global scale.

Until recently, the biggest issue with dating used to be about finding people to date. Over the last 15 years, online dating websites like eHarmony and apps like Tinder have fixed that problem. But in fixing it, a new problem arose. In the past, you’d date people you somewhat knew or had an initial connection with. Today, your online matches are complete strangers with more options, making it harder than ever before to get to know who they are and how they feel about you throughout the dating process. This makes navigating the new world of dating a struggle for those without the right communication skills or experience.

There are a few other companies that recognize this new problem. However, none of them are trying to solve the problem like dating websites and apps solved matchmaking. Unlike them, our business is designed to solve the problem on a global scale.

PMAlerts
S21
Unsuccessful
1) Social listening so much bigger than vanity searching. It's a means to a more actionable end - social listening should help users build relationships and sell solutions. We can use social listening data to build databases of qualified leads for any type of business. We can then learn how to most effectively sell against particular categories of pain / user.

2) It's hard to make the most of social listening. The most effective queries aren't usually obvious. Folks create alerts and then are immediately conditioned to ignore them because first attempts tend to generate noisy results.

For example: I want to find people who need social listening tools. At first, I created an alert for "social listening tool", but I found that an alert for "mrr $" gives me a far higher signal:noise ratio. This can be solved with improved UX and a services component - onboard new users for $x.

3) Customer obsession can be quantified. Big tech's enterprise culture is embracing OKRs like "customer obsession", and PMAlerts could be used to quantify customer obsession. Product teams need an easily measurable (and gamifiable) way to engage with customers / improve product - beyond lagging indicators like MAU / revenue.

4) Consumer-first can be a winning long-term strategy. My competitors are focused primarily on B2B enterprise contracts because that's where the money is. But social listening can be a consumer product. It just needs to be packaged up in a brutally simple way that feels familiar. This is why I'm mimicking the UX of Twitter - I want users to feel like they could visit PMAlerts just as often as they visit other social media sites. Not only for work, but for pleasure too. This way, users pollinate the tool across orgs/employers.

5) Social listening can be a marketplace / platform. My competitors are focused on listening to mainstream social media because they seem to care mostly about macro trend analysis. But social listening can be actionable and tactical. In my opinion, effective use of social listening has you engaging with the results you capture, not just passively reviewing them. And this engagement can be improved by reducing the cost of developing special-purpose niche listeners. A "listener store" could give devs across the globe a way to monetize their scraping skills for a wide variety of use-cases.

6) Social listening can lead us to a healthier form of social media. It can wrap around all social media / niche communities and deliver a simple, ad-free experience on top of a subscription model. The algorithms that power news feeds could focus entirely on user delight, without having to compromise the user experience for advertisers. This would also prevent things like Cambridge Analytica from happening.

Freelance programming in USA is limited because of a 1986 tax reform act that targeted developers. Companies were penalized for hiring developers as 1099 workers and are at risk of being taxed as if their hires were w2.

However, in spite of this, the “gig economy” is here and expanding. Some estimates peg the eventual TAM of the Gig Economy at $1.5T, attributing half of that to IT projects, including software.

The software workforce is growing. Although most freelance developers are not Americans (due to the limitations in American law), with the advent of travel visas (such as Thailand introducing a Digital Nomad visa) and the general growth of the gig economy, freelance software development will grow in size in spite of the legislative roadblocks.

Hiring a freelance software developer is currently like finding a taxi: you call up the cab company and hope that they show up on time or if you live in an area with a high enough volume of cabs, you go outside and hope one shows up near you in time. But with the right dispatch system (quickly matching developers to projects that are a good fit, not only technically but also culturally) and the right structural systems in place to make sure the software projects succeed (enforcing best practices for software development), we could become the Uber for Software.

People understand that hiring is broken. Developers hate recruiters, and companies admit that up to 50% of their software hires are wrong. It’s clear that matching needs fixing.

Freelance software projects are a chance for us to get this right, because freelance projects are small and more frequent than job postings, there is a higher volume of turnover – we get more passes through the funnel in order to get matching right. By the time we have developed a system for consistently outputting high quality software projects (with a lower failure rate), we will have a moat on competitors. Analogy: think about the YC application and its idiosyncrasies that give YC a competitive advantage in fundraising…

I'm an insider to small business, not a professional trained journalist or analyst. I have experience trying to create a meaningful footprint for Twilio, so I know where to look for the data to indicate growth and success. Often their are non-traditional ways to do this that require scraping, crawling, and mucking through seemingly disconnected information - but I can see patterns I think other people miss, and I am willing to dig deeper than anyone else because I find it endlessly fascinating.

People who run banks don't care about providing high quality technology services, and the people who care about technology don't want to work with (or buy) a bank. Schlep blindness, as it were.

Also, there is great power in abstracting away thinking about your particular bank. Take ACH: since we are willing to suffer through forming eight banking relationships, we can provide next-day payouts to 80% of checking accounts in the US. Everyone else can only do next-day payouts on their one bank.

Others are trying to make it easier to accept credit cards or get rid of the physical card. But that whole process is useless. Credit cards work fine. They are just too expensive. Folks working on Bitcoin get it. And we get it. Unlike Bitcoin based businesses, we think government-backed money has redeeming features worth saving.

We have spent almost two years talking to retailers. In quick serve restaurants, for example, the average margin for a retailer run between 1 and 4%, and credit card fees often eat up to 1-2% of total revenues. Often, a reduction of fees by 25% would increase the bottom line by 25%. That’s why our existing retailers are pushing their customers to use our app. We have a direct impact on their bottom line.

1. TRUST. Researchers aren't willing to pay if they can't be sure the data will be good. Participants aren't willing to answer thoughtfully and honestly if they can't trust their efforts will be fairly appreciated. Other companies in our space don't treat their users well – they underpay participants, randomly kick them out of surveys, and don't help mediate or resolve disputes between the two sides of the marketplace (researchers <> participants). As a result, trust is low, data quality is bad, and research progress is way slower than it needs to be.

2. INCENTIVES. Competitors in our space don't get that it's important to align incentives to achieve high data quality. On MTurk, the misaligned incentives create a race to the bottom: Winners are those who complete the most "HITs" per hour, or those who spin up bots to complete "HITs" on their behalf. It's a constant battle between researchers and participants, and it's slow and difficult for the researcher to screen the data for quality.

3. CONTROL. Researchers want transparent access and control over the data collection process because *how* the data is collected will affect the results. Traditional vendors do not realize this – they act as gatekeepers who slow down the research and reduce its quality.

OEMs do realize that using cloud or an on-premise server is not the best way to analyze video content from all the security cameras that are sold by them. Firstly, there is a perpetual cost associated with using it and secondly, there is a limit to the number of videos streams that can be analyzed at the same time with the limited computational power.

For consumers, if the security cameras were to use the cloud, then the bandwidth required to upload the camera feed would be over 40 GB/day – just to figure out if there were unwanted people or vehicles in the video. Worst if the network breaks down leaving them vulnerable.

Making the security camera do the job of identifying the objects is the best way forward. The camera must be made intelligent in itself. And thanks to our technology, the low-cost devices can now analyze the video in real time without the need for depending on the cloud.

A few things really:

Online trade schools are the future. Online courses are a generally ineffective medium for job training as only 13% of those bought are ever finished. For career-changing education, students need a project-based environment with direct access to the instructor and peers (for accountability and social pressure).
Mid-career education and job retraining will continue to become increasingly important. Only 27% of college graduates land a job related to their major. This along with a host of other factors is leading to record job dissatisfaction rates; however, students aren’t willing to enroll in expensive 2–4 year-long programs to fix this problem. They want a more lightweight solution that helps them pick up new skills without the high cost of traditional universities.
Income Share Agreements are essential for any mid-career educational programs to work. Unlike undergraduate programs, which can be financed through the support of your parents and/or student loans, the risk of transitioning to a new career after undergrad is drastically higher. ISA’s help de-risk this transition by requiring students to only pay the institution back if they are successful.

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
That people/companies don’t license task management or project management software to help them write things down. They license this software because they have an underlying need to get more things done.

While digitizing what was previously a pen and paper based task or something that was done over email does provide some benefits it still doesn’t get to the root of the issue.

All of these tools (Trello / Asana / etc) are great at what they do. They cut down the time it takes to find information associated with tasks, to see what it is due, who is responsible for it, etc but they don’t then take that next proactive step of helping you and your team move tasks off of that to-do list.

Task Pigeon solves that issue via our marketplace and the long term vision is centered around helping you and your team get more done. Ultimately this allows businesses to move faster and turn on / off additional resources as and when required.

Flex
S16
Successful
Women (and men) love our branding and positioning. 25% of our signups are from men. We’ve found a way to stand out amongst the cheap, pink-and-purple packaging of traditional feminine hygiene products, and our messaging (mess-free period sex) has been an effective hook to get women to try our product for the first time.

Once women try FLEX, they want to switch to FLEX permanently for a few reasons:

When women wear a pad or tampon, it’s a constant reminder that they’re undergoing this really uncomfortable experience
FLEX is so shockingly comfortable that women tell us that they forget that they’re on their period when wearing it
Instead of running to the bathroom 4–5 times per day to change a leaky tampon, FLEX requires changing only once every 12 hours
It’s very easy to use
In addition to a high-quality product, we’ve created a quality customer experience online. Most menstrual product purchases happen in drug stores, but drug stores don’t facilitate discovery of new feminine hygiene products. Millennials read and shop online, and we’ve created an e-commerce platform that educates them with peer-generated reviews and content.

Women learn about feminine hygiene products from their friends. The bulk of our early traction (20k organic signups) have come from word-of-mouth. On average, every person that signs up to try FLEX, recommends us to at least 1 additional person. Our campus ambassador program is one great example of our grassroots marketing efforts.

Simple Habit
W17

There are two things that companies in our space don't get:

1) Our competitors don't get that users experience meditation fatigue from listening to the same voice/personality over and over again. In other words, they start to tune out. Imagine if Spotify or iTunes only carried one band. One's enjoyment of music would diminish over time. Similarly, the effectiveness of meditation on a listener diminishes over time as they get accustomed to the techniques and personality of the same meditation teacher.

2) Our competitors also don't understand that teachers can be a powerful channel for user acquisition. The key to developing this channel is to focus on creating a great experience for meditation teachers. This includes setting up the right financial incentive structure for teachers and building them tools that enable and encourage them to be an evangelist of Simple Habit.

OpenPhone

Dropbox
S07

Competing products work at the wrong layer of abstraction and/or force the user to constantly think and do things. The "online disk drive" abstraction sucks, because you can't work offline and the OS support is extremely brittle. Anything that depends on manual emailing/uploading (i.e. anything web-based) is a non-starter, because it's basically doing version control in your head. But virtually all competing services involve one or the other.

With Dropbox, you hit "Save", as you normally would, and everything just works, even with large files (and binary diffs ensure that only the changed portions go over the wire).

Courier

Courier has three paid pricing plans that discriminate based upon the number of notifications sent per month. This maps to how incumbent single-channel notification providers charge and I expect Courier to be able to charge prices comparable to a single-channel provider. The customer will be paying for both Courier and the underlying providers so it may result in Courier only being able to charge some fraction of a comparable single-channel provider.

There are at least two existing individual channels that support $100M+ ARR (and in some cases much, much more) and two more supporting $10M+ ARR in revenue for the leader(s) in that space: email (SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), mobile push (Amazon SNS, OneSignal, Urban Airship), browser push (Pusher). Achieving revenues in excess of $100M ARR is achievable.

MagicBell

We charge a subscription fee for MagicBell's APIs and UI components. The pricing depends on a combination of the number of channels, active user count, notifications volume, and data retention period. Given the business model and deep integration into our customers’ code-base, we expect low churn and healthy expansion revenue (150-200% YoY).

At an average revenue per account of $4k/mo and net revenue retention of 150%, we expect to make $30million/yr in the next five years or so, given the right growth capital. The first-mover advantage, combined with the growing market opportunity and our team's expertise in SaaS, makes this a realistic target.

We’ll make money with a SaaS subscription by charging $20-50/user/month and then charging for notebooks deployed as APIs on a usage-basis. We think we could be every DS’ daily driver tool so we could make a lot of money.

For rough market sizing, we’ll assume that we can charge $25/user/month. According to LinkedIn there are 2.6M Data Engineers, 350K ML Engineers and 400K Data Scientists in the US alone, all of whom use Jupyter Notebooks everyday.

For our notebooks product alone, we could make 25*12*3.35M = $1.05B/Yr. But more importantly, after we are successful in becoming the daily driver for DS, DE and MLEs, we can sell an E2E Data platform to our customers later which is a *much* larger market.

Simula
S18
Unsuccessful
1. Marketplace (possibly token based). Simula could be used as a platform to build a marketplace for 3D work applications. In particular, we have considered the possibility that a cryptoasset model might be adequate through some sort of decentralized app marketplace (emphasis: this would be a long-term decision, and not a scheme for the stakeholders to get rich quick off of an ICO).

2. Licensing Fees. Right now we intend for the OS to be free and permissively licensed, but perhaps down the line this could change into a dual-license model.

3. Search Ads. Canonical monetizes Ubuntu by putting Amazon affiliate links in their start menu search results. We could try to do something similar with Simula.

4. Strategic Asset. We don’t know much about tech M&A, but it’s conceivable that a bigger company could swallow us. For example, Canonical might purchase our window manager to meaningfully differentiate Ubuntu from Apple.

(1) is our favorite option. This would incentivize the creation of innovative 3D office applications, and could give us a valuation comparable to other large app stores (i.e., in excess of $10BB). (4) is our least favorite option.

We can make about $2.3B/yr ($300MM/yr from team sites, $2B/yr for player profiles, and $2MM from recruiters).

Parsnip
S21
Unsuccessful
The current plan is a standard subscription model. At $100-$150/year/user and my current burn rate I could hire my first employee, have a modest marketing budget and be ramen profitable with around 2,000 users. Fluent Forever, Giphy for flashcards, was able to break 25,000 users in its first 18 months.

Looking at concrete numbers in the larger market there are between 300 million (Duolingo total users) - 2 billion (total language learners worldwide) potential users. There is large potential for multiple $1Bn businesses in this space. Stepping back to Babbel, since Duolingo has a freemium model, they still have revenue >$100M and have sold more than 10M subscriptions.

In the future I plan to sell premium content such as ebooks bundles, which would contain the native language edition, audiobook, and the translated edition. For publishers/localizers this would be a residual revenue stream with almost no added work on their part. For users it would simplify the process of obtaining legal copies of foreign language books while providing a consolation prize to users whose eyes are larger than their skills. However I am much less sure about the potential size of these products.

There are 500 successfully crowd-funded hardware projects on KickStarter and Indiegogo since November 2013.

Similarly, DataMiner has made millions helping the news guys observe events as they happen going from labels of “this might be newsworthy” to “lots of people are talking about this; you should check this out”. We hope that our service will be an even bigger asset to news media companies bringing more than volume statistics through analytics. With early research, these contracts have figures in the millions.

One Month Rails (One Month)
S13
Successful
In less than 5 months of existence, One Month Rails has made over $80,000 in revenue by selling our product across platforms like Skillshare, Udemy, and General Assembly. For-profit trade institutions like University of Phoenix (which is shifting its focus online) have been able to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per year from their programming departments alone.

Now consider this: 16% of sites on the web are built on Wordpress, a blog publishing platform people use because it's probably the easiest way to get a good looking site live relatively quickly. Yet even something as simple as getting your own Wordpress site up is way too complicated for most people. People who use One Month Rails are able to have their own application live on Heroku in less than half an hour.

If One Month Rails can provide people a better and more flexible alternative for helping individuals deploy their web applications, the potential impact reaches far beyond just education. Imagine a world in which everyone has the understanding and tools necessary to build not just a content site but an entire web application.

As One Month Rails evolves to better serve the needs of non-technical people building web applications by including web app hosting, plugins, and other services, the potential market grows well into the billions of dollars per year (if cloud solutions like Salesforce or Windows Azure are any indication).

now: We are experimenting with 3 pricing tiers: $9 a month for the AI coach, $55 monthly to add 1 personal coaching session to check in, review your goals and set new ones. And for non Oura-ring users we aim to charge $100+ a month, buy the ring for the user and include 2 coaching sessions.
later: once the AI coach is good enough we can charge the going rate of 1on1 coaching ($80-$200) per session. Assuming 5% of the Apple Watch users (100Million total) who own more than 1 tracking device (25%) book 1 session per month. = 1/4 of 5 Million = 1.25 million x $80 per session = $100 Million per month.

MakeGamesWithUs (Make School)
W12

We will make money by taking a portion of the revenue from the games we publish.

Every addition to our game catalog is created at no incremental cost to us. We use live metrics and machine learning algorithms to estimate the lifetime expected value of each game and adjust our promotional spending and crosspromotions accordingly.

Additionally, app sales are top heavy, so by not being selective and simply
providing tools to facilitate high quality app development, we will sooner or
later have a blockbuster on our hands.

In our first two years we are targeting 450k in revenue with a 30% revenue share on 300 apps that average $5000 in sales each. From there as we continue to grow our catalog the average sales of each app will increase as well.

The Muse
W12
Successful
We have a clear step-­by-­step sense of how we could make $40M/year and market data that suggests a much larger opportunity if we can figure out how to monetize it. Currently, we're interested in:

Recruiting:
- Email newsletters targeted by industry containing a mixture of content, paid job postings and sponsorships;
- A dynamic job board organized by industry and location, with additional predictive abilities telling candidates who possess certain skills or are looking in certain niche areas to consider [ X ] job in an unrelated field which fits a similar profile;
- A large resume database which recruiters and hiring managers can access and search for a fee, again with predictive and skills-­based abilities to suggest that a certain professional in finance might be a very good fit for a lead dev role at a burgeoning start­up

(To go bottom up, we believe email newsletters can get a $250 CPM for targeted job listings and a $2500 finders' fee for successful hires; job boards for our demographic can charge roughly $350/post, and resume database access runs roughly $1000 per recruiter per month ­ more if predictive functions are added. Top down, there are 7.5M women in our demographic changing jobs every year. If the top 10% are worth $20,000 each time that happens, the overall addressable market for recruiting alone is $15B.)

Training & Professional Development:
- Direct to customer or business / white labeled training program (a natural extension of our core content which we've already been approached about by several companies)

(To go bottom up, we believe individuals will pay $15 per course or, as LearnVest & Lynda have demonstrated, $120-­$250 for a year of access to courses. Businesses, on the other hand, spend over $55B every year on training and development in the US alone, and this market has a 9.8% CAGR).

Advertising & Branded Content:

-Examples here include content branded by Dove's self esteem campaign; sponsorship of our "Finance" vertical by CitiCards, or an AmEx and Dell sponsored Women's Symposium

Lollipuff
W13
Successful
We charge a 7% commission on each sale. To start, Lollipuff will represent just 3 brands. Extrapolating Ebay’s completed listings for these three brands, there is more $77 Million in annual transactions ($5 Million revenue based on our commission). Ebay is undeserving of this niche. Many users refuse to use Ebay or other online sites for high-end items (ie. relying on consignment stores instead). In fact, we have several Ebay “power sellers” asking to use our services!

We plan to introduce additional designers / brands as we grow. Additional revenue will be generated by affiliates (eg. for brands not currently represented.)

We get a 6 to 10% commission on every loan generated by our platform. There are 11 million public servants and 30+ million retired in Brazil, which represents 90% of the payroll-deductible loan market.

Let’s say we focus only in the Federal Government servants. There are around 1.1 million of them. If we get around 2k users helping them get their 5 next payroll-deductible loans (from the ˜30 they take in their life) we could be making around USD 1 million. If we help them re-take more loans we can go up to USD 5 million.

We can always expand to other markets like Mexico, Colombia and Caribe, and also to the closest market which is to go to other Government branches like the regional Government, local Government, Army to reach the total of 11 million people. And, we could also go the other 30% of the market: retired people (+30 million people in Brazil).

- SAM (Brazil): 11 million public servants, 30+ million retired = 41 million people.
- Federal Governmt SAM (beach head): 1.1 million public servants
- Initial goal: 10,000 Federal Government servants, 1 loan each = US$ 1 million revenue
With recurring loans (already an offline trend), we project US$ 15 million.

Pic ur Photo
S19
Unsuccessful
Our customers buy photos individually, and they can choose upsells like edits and prints. We make a cut on every photo sold (the photographer makes the rest), and we take 100% of the revenue on upsells.

The global photo services industry is worth about $30B, including $2B in the UK and $10B in the US. But we’re not just working for the existing market. Our main offering also appeals to people who would never have considered professional photography prior to being introduced to us.

We aim to sell a total of 1 million photos in our first 2 years of operation, which translates to about £7.3M ($9.5M) in revenue (photos + upsells) for us and our photographers. We see ourselves selling 10 million photos annually once we’ve expanded to other major cities in 5-6 years.

Sales will be through Amazon, Print on Demand, bookstores and contract with filmmakers and businesses for signature stories. Most royalties will go to Writers %50 — Editors, Illustrator and marketing %35 — Syllble %15.

Spreadsheet Magic
S14
Unsuccessful
I think most obvious way is just to sell the system either as subscription product (SaaS) or with upfront price.

Given that the tool gives users ability to solve their real business problems, I assume that it should be possible to charge around $50/month for it (based on my experience selling Hosted CI).

If you’ve already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?

I’ve been thinking out ideas for several months, however I’ve only started working on prototype this March and have spent several days putting together some prototype.

Starting with a bottom up approach, our initial target market will be startups with 1 to 500 employees.

Our immediate source of revenue will be a SaaS-based pricing model of $6/month for each employee that participates with no setup costs or annual fees. 44 million Americans have student debt, charging $6/month x 12 months would produce $3.16 billion in ARR.

The total U.S. student loan market is $1.5 trillion (larger than all consumer credit cards and auto loans) and growing by $2,726 per second.

Bipartisan legislation in Congress would make up to $5,250 a year in employer contributions for student loan repayment tax-free. The bill has 118 co-sponsors as of April 17, 2018.

Apptimize
S13
Successful
The plan is a monthly subscription. We’ll offer customers help with experiment design. If we charge premium customers $1K per month and get 200 customers (less than 2 sales a week) over 2 years we’d make ~$2.4MM per year 2 years in. Artisan (launched this month) claims to charge $1K-$10K per month, so that’s possibly a better price.

Ultimately we want to be the default way people change their apps. Everyone would use Apptimize to test each idea, and then use Apptimize to deliver the change to users. 100% of apps would use our library to reduce time to propagate changes and tighten the app development cycle. We’d help erase the line between apps and the web.

I will be using the typical SaaS business model and charging a monthly fee to companies using Trestle probably on a per-head basis. Companies are currently spending hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars of engineering time building and maintaining these systems. The problem I’m solving for companies is almost unboundedly valuable, it makes the entire organization more effective as it scales. In the long term, Trestle could also start to eat into the traditional HRIS space and start offering features such as onboarding, benefits, payroll, etc. to provide an even more valuable and comprehensive solution.

In just the US, as of 2012, there are over 100,000 businesses with over 100 employees employing a total of over 75 million people. Even if just 1% of businesses use Trestle, and it’s priced at $10/head, that’s over $90 million in revenue per year.

PMAlerts

Unsuccessful
A monthly subscription fee that users pay to keep their alerts listening.

Paths to $100M ARR:

- 17,000 users paying $500/mo
- 42,000 users paying $200/mo
- 83,000 users paying $100/mo
- 300,000 users paying $30/mo

There are:

- 21M software engineers who want to get closer to their customers
- 10M big tech workers who want to get closer to their customers
- 1M PMs who want to get closer to their customers
- 150,000 SalesForce customers who pay for enterprise CRM
- 2.5M active Etsy shops who would benefit from social selling
- 150,000 users paying for LinkedIn Sales Navigator

Gumroad creators, crowdfunding efforts - anyone with a business or value to provide - could accelerate their revenue growth / PMF with PMAlerts. TAM seems at least as big as Slack + Salesforce.

If PMAlerts becomes a thin layer on top of all social media that delivers a composible social media experience - circumventing ad-driven social media feeds - I see $10/mo * 10% of say 1B social media users = $1B ARR.

100,000 people paying $100/mo to generate leads = $120M ARR

We collect subscription fees from developers and hiring managers. We charge developers $45/month (with a discount for early adopters or multiple licenses, such as in the case of a bootcamp). We charge hiring managers anywhere from $0 to $200/month/developer for the duration of their contract.

We estimate the freelance programming market to be anywhere from $500M to $3B in annual volume currently, depending on whether you include IT staffing in the definition of “freelance programmers”. Intermediary services get away with charging anywhere from 5% to 50%, so our annual revenue could be anywhere from $25M to $1.5B if we own the market. That’s immediately. Freelancing as a market is growing, though… with some estimates of the TAM maturing to $1.5T annually.

Even immediately, however, there are opportunities for us to pivot our matching software into adjacent markets. Prospects have asked me if I could service other freelance markets: video post production, web design, marketing gigs… for now, we are focusing on conquering the software development market before expanding adjacently.

Card processing costs US businesses $50 billion each year. Like card processors, we’ll charge a transaction fee. Card processors make a lot of money, but their margins are thin. They can’t reduce fees to compete. Their high fees are caused by the structure of their network. We can charge 1% where they have to charge 2-5%.

Assuming our existing engagement rate, we will make $22 million a year once we reach 20,000 retailers. US has 1.1 million retailers. At our existing engagement rate, our total addressable market would be $1.2 billion a year.

We currently charge a 30% commission to individual customers for the core service of finding and screening research participants. Going forward, new products and services (e.g., representative samples, external API) will add additional revenue streams and enable upsell. And we're currently working on a SAAS hybrid model (subscription + participant rewards) for institutions and enterprises.

The market opportunity is huge. The "people research" space alone (we which we define as behavioral science + user research + market research) is a $100B+ global opportunity, but this is just the beginning as this market is nascent and growing. Fundamentally, we're developing a broad solution to a worldwide problem (learning about people).

We plan on making money in three phases:

- 1st phase: pro account (custom badge, priority support, once a month zoom chat, etc)
- 2nd phase: server side features (eg. private hosting, cloud sync, online editor)
- 3rd phase: team features (small teams to enterprise)

We also have a completely orthogonal revenue plan that involves creating a marketplace for notes. This involves making it easy for people to publish and monetize their knowledge - think substack/medium but for notes. This would vastly increase our addressable marketplace (to anyone that needs to consume information) but also a departure from our current plans of making revenue. This is something that we would likely explore either in conjunction of after phase 3.

We will make money by selling and installing our equipment on existing vehicles. Over time, more of our revenue will come from subscriptions fees.

J.D. Power surveyed 17,000 drivers in 2012 and found that 20% would"probably" or "definitely" buy self‑driving technology in their next vehicle at an estimated market price of $3k.

If that survey is even remotely representative of the rest of the country, those drivers who are ready to buy today will create at least a $100 billion market in the US alone.

We make money through recurring enterprise sales. There are around 80K High Schools in America that don’t offer any Computer Science courses. We estimate our average deal size will 35k (half the average cost of running Computer Science courses through conventional means). This gives us a total market size of close to $3 Billion in America alone.

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
At its core Task Pigeon is a SaaS task management application with both free and paid tiers. Our free tier is limited to a maximum of 5 users and has more limited functionality. The paid tier starts at $9 USD per user, per month.

Our marketplace offering augments this and provides an additional revenue stream. We have adopted a typical marketplace model and take 20% of the fee from the freelancer.

Long term I expect the split of revenue to be 70% from Monthly Recurring Revenue associated with the task management application and 30% coming from the marketplace.

Applications such as Asana have shown that there is demand for a paid task management application. According to recent reports they have 50,000 paying customers. Even if we assume an average of 10 team members per team (likely to be much higher once we engage enterprise level accounts) that would equate to 500,000 paying users or $4.5 million in Monthly Recurring Revenue (at $9 USD per user, per month).

I really only see that as the start though and am taking on this startup because I see a path to building a multi-billion dollar company. Why? Because the future of the workforce is likely to be split 50/50 between employees and freelancers.

That means that 50% of the current staff budget of corporations all across the world is potentially going to be allocated to engaging with freelancers. To make that process streamlined though there first of all needs to be a task management application that marries task management with access to freelancers together.

Task Pigeon provides this access, so in time we become much more important to a company than merely being a task management application. We provide access to freelancers on-demand so that their employees/teams can get more done each day (and without all the hassle of posting jobs, waiting for responses, haggling over times, etc).

With 125 million formal SME’s in the world even if we take just the top 10% of the market this results in 12,500,000 SME’s that could potentially benefit from our product and service. If we assume an average of 10 employees at this top tier and an average cost per user of $9 USD per month that equates to an total addressable market of $13.5 billion p.a. for the task management side alone.

If we then assume just 30% of the top 10% of SME’s engage with a freelancer platform that’s a total marekt of 3.75m SME’s. If they each spent on average $500 on outsourced work each year that’s an additional market of $1.87billion to target (with our marketplace set up to take 20% of all fees).

Targeting the SME market proves how there is a multi-billion dollar market in both segments. In time of course we believe going upstream to enterprise clients will only expand this number and our potential. In fact 25% of Fortune 500 companies are already using freelancers / on-demand workers and a report by Accenture showed that 85% of IT and Business executives expect to increase their use of freelancers in the coming year.

Simple Habit

In the US alone, 18M people are meditating (reported by Forbes), and this number keeps increasing every year. Capturing [redacted] of these users is a [redacted] business at our current subscription pricing. However, we consider this just the start of what we can do.

According to research by IBISWorld, the meditation and mindfulness industry ranked in nearly $1 billion in 2015. The space is growing very rapidly. More than 22% of employers currently offer mindfulness training for their workforce. However, meditation and mindfulness is just the tip of an iceberg. We believe there are a LOT of ways to monetize a large audience of people who trust our company to guide their activities around their health. We'd like to take on larger market of mental health, stress relief and health & wellness which is a trillion dollar industry.

Seeing Interactive (Own Local)

We are already making money. Our current product grosses several thousand dollars per month in revenue.

Our most immediate source of revenue is direct from newspapers. Each newspaper pays us between several hundred and several thousand dollars for services. In the future, we will also present products directly to small businesses through newspaper ad reps in a tiered pricing scheme.

For example, the local directory product that we are currently developing will sell directly to businesses for between $20 and $200 per month and we get a cut. The customers who are buying these services are accustomed to paying $40 just to place business-card sized ads in the paper once a week, so if they are interested in marketing via the internet, this purchase should be a no-brainer. Really though, it doesn't matter what we charge: $n 6,000,000 small-business is a number we can live with.

Mostly by selling subscriptions that entitle our customers to support and our proprietary GitLab Enterprise Edition. Our most sold subscription by revenue costs $49 per user per year. Most or our revenue comes from organizations with more than 100 paying users. Every company with a substantial number of developers needs software like ours. We already declined an acquisition offer from a competitor for $10M because we want to grow this into a large company.

Dropbox
S07
Successful
The current plan is a freemium approach, where we give away free 1GB accounts and charge for additional storage (maybe ~$5/mo or less for 10GB for individuals and team plans that start at maybe $20/mo.). It's hard to get consumers to pay for things, but fortunately small/medium businesses already pay for solutions that are subsets of what Dropbox does and are harder to use. There will be tiered pricing for business accounts (upper tiers will retain more older versions of documents, have branded extranets for secure file sharing with clients/partners, etc., and an 'enterprise' plan that features, well, a really high price.)

I've already been approached by potential partners/customers asking for a web services API to programmatically create Dropboxes (e.g. to handle file sharing for Assembla.com, a web site for managing global dev teams). There's a natural synergy between project mgmt/groupware web apps (which do to-do lists, calendaring, etc. well but not files) and Dropbox for file sharing. I've also had requests for an enterprise version that would sit on a company's network (as opposed to my S3 store) for which I could probably charge a lot.

Q: How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

We offered them the same price as that of Metro at zero delivery fees. The rest 40 were added by these customers through referrals. All 100 stores are within a locality of 3 km radius.

It is evident that a large fraction of small store operators would require 1-1 onboarding to start using B2B ecommerce apps. Hence, our plan is to grow users through a mix of 1-1 onboarding, referral campaigns and tie up with bookkeeping apps with high penetration to add more users. We do not have a chicken-and-egg problem.

Our blog post describing the challenge of building a complete notification brings us one lead a week. Given the search volume for relevant keywords, we plan to publish more valuable content to double down on organic user acquisition.

We hope to accelerate all these efforts with the additional funding from YC.

Our value proposition to these people: “take your Vive, plug it into your Linux system, and multiply your screen real estate by 10.” For these people, our product should be so good that they want to use us for more than 1hr/day.

2. 10,000-100,000 Users: Ensure that the absolute best 3D office applications are made available on our platform/marketplace (while others are focused on games/entertainment, we we will be focused on office work).

Before launching my prototype I recruited people for interviews and other feedback directly from Reddit and other forums I’m a part of while experimenting with posting to social media. So far I’ve talked with dozens of people on Reddit and other forums and interviewed around two dozen people individually over Zoom and chat.

While beta testing I will engage with people on forums, create content and do other audience building activities creating a foundation for later search engine optimization (SEO) to improve organic reach. An example might be “A vocabulary analysis of popular fiction books.” I can look at the number of unique words vs the total words in the first Harry Potter, then discuss how many new words would you need to read for each additional book in the series.

Once the beta wraps up I plan to do a full scale launch starting with a kickstarter. Building awareness and anticipation through social media along with Facebook and Google Ads.

For a product of our own we’d need to attract potential users by having a narrative for the social benefit of “news literacy”. Minds are changed through emotion rather than factual concrete evidence so this application would be more of a training to see both sides idea instead of showing someone raw evidence against their position. In this manner we’d be very chicken-and-egg. As a service, we’ll get users by sales and marketing showing how much value we could add to markets like high frequency trading or politics. We’d have to lineup demos and grow through grassroots from the beginning.

We use content as a lead gen to attract users: our content is currently syndicated out via Huffington Post, Forbes, Business Insider, and Inc, and we're working on closing a video deal with HuffPost that will drive additional thousands of users back to our site. One of our strategies that has been very successful has been having inspirational and influential women write original content for The Daily Muse.

Arianna Huffington wrote the lead article for our launch in September, and she's been followed by women ranging from Cindy Gallop and Rachel Sklar to the head of the U.S. Geological Survey. Marissa Mayer from Google and Nicole Lapin from CNBC have agreed to write as well.

We've also agreed to a partnership with Refinery29, a global fashion newsletter with 500,000 subscribers, to provide information & plugs for The Daily Muse to all of their subs in November in exchange for awesome tailored career content from us. If it goes well, we plan to extend it.

We’ve gained most of our users/paying customers with an Instagram DM campaign. We target specific niches and our name vibrates around the same circles of friends.

Companies will pay hundreds to get in front of even a micro-influencer’s audience, but we have paying customers with thousands of followers gladly uploading our photos and spreading the word, thanks to the shareable nature of our product.

We’ve also just begun holding interviews for something called the street team. Our managed teams will storm the streets of London to fill remaining slots for the week. We’ve already done this on a trial basis, but we just finished getting the legal ok and building the software to handle logistics and do it in mass.

Our longterm acquisition strategy focuses heavily on content marketing and SEO. People are increasingly looking to social media as inspiration on where to eat, how to dress, where to go, how to frame the perfect photo.

People travel more because of the beauty they see in photos. People dress differently, eat new things, and connect with a lifestyle a photo represents. Instagram and Pinterest are great places for inspiration, but they’re lacking in detail needed to create.

There’s a desire and a need for information on exactly where and how to take the most awe-inspiring images. We’ll partner with content creators in each city we want to launch to become the go-to place to find the content our target audience is searching for, and as soon as they want to be in the photo, we’ll be there to catch them with a “negligibly-priced” photosession.

I fully acknowledge Slack’s bottoms-up approach is a better sales tactic and I will continue experimenting to see if there is a way to make Trestle useful on a team-by-team basis, but currently Trestle is most useful when everyone in the company has profiles on the platform. Once companies reach over 100 people, these decision makers (COO, Head of People, Head of Internal Tools, etc.) already clearly understand the problem and realize that they will either have to buy a solution (Trestle) or build and maintain it in house, which makes the sales process easier.

SEO and social urges are primary drivers of our traffic. One of the advantages of hosting a full book on site is that we can extract SEO juice from the “inner pages” of the book. This capability is not available to any other publisher because they'd have to link to a file outside of web.

Second, social urges. Readers love talking about the book that they have read or a passage that they liked. We tap into these individual urges to reach further into their network of friends. Organic search and social drive 70% of our reader traffic.

Third is meet-ups and local writing groups. We work with writers and help them publish using modern tools and get the word out. In the process we increase our outreach with each new book alongside a campaign undertaken by the writer.

- Act as the "salesforce" for small startups - manually creating alerts and personally pushing users to product.
- Apply to SMM / PR / PM positions specifically to demo PMAlerts to hiring managers / teams that budget for social media tools.
- Create shareable "topic pages" with PMAlerts (a topic page for a YCombinator startup, for example) that gives folks a single place to see what people are saying about the startup across the whole web.
- Create educational materials (video, blogs, books, a podcast, etc).
- Sell consulting services to businesses who are new to social media monitoring / social selling.
- Produce sketch comedy routines where the PMAlerts "bot" (a human with a big robot helmet) sneaks into meetings / eavesdrops on customer conversations and then runs like mad across various scenes (subway, city, park, etc) to to share the latest details with you, the user.
- Produce a video series where early-stage startups are brought from 0 to 100 paying customers by using PMAlerts to find + talk to customers.
- Offer an API that devs can use to build on top of social listening capabilities
- Cold-call PR / marketing agencies to sell them a whitelabeled PMAlerts subscription (that they can offer to their customers)

We currently have five customer acquisition channels that are effective for sourcing freelance software developers: Reddit ads; Indie Hackers community participation; Instagram (organic– suggests that paid Instagram could work as well); Social media articles; the books, 30 Days To Your First Freelance Programming Client and Software Engineer’s Guide to Freelance Consulting – I estimate 1 in every 200 readers becomes a customer. Using Amazon Marketing Services, I estimate that we can move books at scale for about -$2 net per copy.

The main point to get across is that I’m confident we could scale paid acquisition of freelance developers, although LTV is approximately == CAC, and through product improvements (reducing churn) and normal growth hacking, we are on a mission to move LTV == 3X CAC.

It has occurred to me that some of our users come from referrals from fellow users. So we technically have six customer acquisition channels, including referrals.

However, we don’t yet have scalable systems for acquiring hiring manager customers (aside from networking and referrals– not *scalable*). Although our social media articles (designed to attract developers) are also accidentally finding us hiring managers, (including developers who are, internally, responsible for hiring), we don’t have a system where we can spend $X and ensure $Y hiring manager signups. In fact, we don’t yet have a software product for hiring managers to manage the hiring process… everything is done manually, with me often not charging the hiring managers and working closely with them to recruit a developer to their project, simply in order to facilitate customer learning.

We’re overcoming the chicken-and-egg problem this presents by writing scrapers to scour the Internet for freelance programming jobs, and we’ve written scrapers for about 50 different markets so far.

Currently, the bottleneck is scalable systems for signing up freelance hiring managers, but we haven’t even built software to manage the freelancer hiring process yet, though it will be shipped by the end of October, if not sooner. Now, after many conversations, we know what to build and what aspects are important, systematically addressing the bottlenecks within the hiring process, itself: pre-screening with rubric-based technical evaluations, having a spec, getting the description in front of developers who are well-suited to it in terms of ability and availability, signing developers to NDAs where appropriate, conducting reference checks, and transparently monitoring of the process, for both sides.

Right now, retailers prompt users to download our app and 12% of those who walk into our retailers download our app. We are in the process of significantly upgrading our user app. The new app will embed ACH/Credit transactions. Our new, updated app will grow much faster because it embeds P2P transfers which give us both a network effect and a use case outside our retail locations. Users will now have a reason to download and use the app outside stores. We will target users outside stores using Facebook ads. Our initial testing suggests that we’ll be able to acquire users for about $1 per user.

We have two channels of attracting retailers now. First, we pay for inbound leads. Second, we have sold our product to enterprise, multi-location retailers who make it mandatory for all their franchisees.

We will accelerate virtuous growth cycles by building tools for data reuse, sharing, and collaboration. We'll further enhance network effects and lock-in by developing an API platform and an ecosystem of tools and a community around it. Plus, we'll start doing direct sales to reach new institutional and enterprise customer segments where we have low penetration.

As a marketplace, balanced growth of both sides of the platform is important, and we've already solved the first stage of the chicken-and-egg problem with 30,000+ monthly active participants and 2000+ monthly active researchers. We have an allocation algorithm which distributes studies evenly to participants ensuring balanced platform growth.

This is a marketplace and we get around the chicken-and-egg problem with our health tracking dashboard and order-forwarding.

With our health tracking dashboard, users can select from a list of 30+ widgets to monitor their health, log their meals, track their nutrition and follow exercise plans. This means there’s a “single-player mode” available on our app upon launch.

The order-forwarding is in effect a “backward compatibility” feature to ensure ordering is immediately available from venues that we’ve web-scraped. It’s by initially embedding ourselves with pre-existing services that we plan to build up our “multiplayer mode” so users can order and interact with venues.

We’ve spoken to dozens of venues and they’ve asked to see an active userbase before committing to the app. With this in mind, the strategy is to magnetise the app with the health-tracking dashboard so venues come to us. This also mitigates the reliance on a sales-team to onboard venues which in turn significantly reduces the operational cost that has otherwise held back many competitors from growth.

Task Pigeon is live and has seen 17% average growth in Monthly Active Users over the last 8 months. Currently our user acquisition strategy focuses heavily on content marketing and SEO. I have been developing a comprehensive blog at https://blog.taskpigeon.co even prior to our launch.

We do run some retargeting campaigns using Google Adwords and Facebook Ads but the budget on this is minimal at this stage and is more about keeping Task Pigeon front and center of mind for those who are going through out 14 day free trial.

Interestingly enough, unlike most startups with a marketplace we haven’t faced the traditional chicken/egg issue. Most people who sign up for Task Pigeon originally engage with our application because of our task management capabilities. It is then within the app that they learn about their ability to outsource tasks via our marketplace in just a few clicks. As a result we have a growing user base to tap into for our marketplace offering.

On the supply side I have developed a curated list of freelancers who I have worked with in the past. When a new job comes in via the marketplace it is routed to one of the pre-vetted freelancers I have worked with. While this isn’t scaleable it will serve our needs until we have 20+ orders a day coming in. At which point we will need to source additional freelancers for the platform but will be able to do so with the proposition that we have business waiting for them straight away.

Zac declared this idea when he signed his at Stripe. He's asked Stripe for an IP waiver letter, or whatever it's called.

(I also described this entire idea in a youtube video I sent to you in December before we didn't accept a late interview, so...there is a lot of documentary evidence that I had this IP before Stripe).

I’m not one of those non-technical founders who doesn’t have a clue. I tapped into my network to make sure I was bringing on the right people and am extremely proud of my resourcefulness and ability to bootstrap Task Pigeon to where it is today. In fact I built our entire MVP for only $8,000 (and that included the cost of registering the company)

I also consider myself a “semi-technical founder” I can have detailed conversations with my team and have learned enough HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.JS to understand the inner workings of our application. To save costs I also have the ability to build the website/landing pages myself.

The benefits I have of outsourcing is that I can be extremely cost efficient. Even $10,000 USD would allow me to significantly advance Task Pigeon from where it is today.

This designation is much like a Fair Trade or LEED certification and signals that we’re committed to making a profound social difference and safeguarding people and the planet, while remaining profitable.

Christian’s ideas include:

- A social experiment much like Facebook where every login or session has you assume the role and identity of a fictitious person. All data created by you while in the role of this person persists upon session expiration or sign out. Each time you log back in you must put yourself in the shoes of the previously created identity and post as such breaking the echo chamber that is social media today while also having fun.
- Event-going today has turned into a very spontaneous unscheduled sort of thing. Often times I find myself wishing to get in touch with the people I met within the context of some random evening for pictures, videos and just networking in general. Think of this as a digital collection of your concert/sports tickets where each one expands into your experience prior and after the specific event!
- Having spent 3 summers abroad in Barcelona working closely with nightlife promoters, one thing they always talk about for general improvement of their day to day is a way to more easily get in touch with their network to predict figures for guest lists and to not spam as much. Think of this as a 1 degree removed connection of the promoter and I want to hand over my network list of those specific few that are headed to Barcelona for vacation. Hopefully this would be that he’d have my network only for the time that my friends are travelling to cut through on the spam.

However... we do have ideas for auxiliary uses of our platform. Consignment shops (both online and off) often lack expertise in authenticating clients’ goods too. Using our authentication expertise, we could provide a service to such stores. The store could go through the authentication process in the same way as creating an auction listing. Instead of placing the item up for bid, we could generate a “certificate of authenticity” that could be displayed (and verified via a Lollipuff URL) to potential buyers. In this way, we become a trust service... much like the origins of “PayPal verified.”

In science/engineering, things are very straight-forward: apply an electric or magnetic field, and electrons move in a predictable fashion. But humans are totally mysterious beings… where the colour of a button can have all sorts of effects.

Trying to figure out what people around the world want, what they will pay for, and generally what they’re thinking when they use a website is very challenging and often surprising, although taking a scientific approach (testing and measuring) has been very helpful.

FStop.fm connected models to photographers, but if I had to try again, I'd make it the easiest way for businesses to get creative work done. "Project management for creative teams". MVP done, 50k+ users from my original attempt in 2016. I applied to YC twice with this idea.

GuardMyPad.com is a SaaS home security solution built on WebRTC that lets people recycle old devices into motion-detecting security cameras that record media into their cloud storage accounts / local device storage. The MVP for this was finished in 2017, but I never brought it to market because I didn't know how. My mission with this was to give lower-income folks a free way to recycle their old tech into a "better than nothing" security solution.

Karma is a public notebook / collaborative self-education platform (like Roam, but social). I'm using this to internalize a lot of YC / Startup School lectures, eg https://www.karma.fm/p/yINKGvw/how-to-sell-by-tyler-bosmeny https://www.karma.fm/p/vszjKtl/do-things-that-dont-scale---paul-graham

CondoGrades is meant to give power to residents/owners who have fallen victim to incompetent HOAs / property management companies / abusive landlords. It would begin as Yelp for condos - "get paid to grade your HOA". Renters and homeowners would get paid to provide data that CondoGrades sells to home buyers / real estate agents. Landlords would pay for the ability to respond to public renter feedback.

Tweet.fm is a voice-based twitter alternative built on subscriptions (no ads).

Rolo is an omnichannel CRM solution - connect your Rolo account to all social media + email channels, and have one place to communicate with customers on whatever channel they prefer (Twitter DMs, emails, Facebook messages, etc).

Kanban is like a public Trello that allows people to contribute to projects via small tasks, and get paid for closing out those tasks. "Public project management" positioned to support the growing needs of decentralized projects. (PG's talk on "solving email" by treating it like a TODO list is what inspired this - step 1: forward emails into a spam-detecting Trello-like interface so you never have to visit an inbox again, step 2: evolve from private, personal task management to collaborative project management).

Docs.fm is a simple docs-tracking utility that automatically reminds product teams to review / QA / sign off on their technical documentation. This is a huge problem for product teams - technical docs tend to go stale because our systems don't make it easy for PMs / EMs / SWEs to form a healthy documentation habit. Docs.fm is the habit-forming solution.

Unionite is a universal unionization platform / "nonviolent resistance as a service".

BitSpend is a simple tax calculator for crypto holders who spend their holdings and need an easy way to calculate their cost basis / tax liability. It just needs your public wallet address(es) and your income bracket. Then, you tell it when you spend, and it spits out the lowest possible tax liability based on when your crypto was purchased (first in, last out to minimize tax). All in a format that's easily attachable to your state/federal tax returns.

Courier

When I incorporated Courier via Stripe Atlas in January, it was the middle of the government shutdown. Atlas uses Rocket Lawyer to file the necessary paperwork, including for your EIN. After some time it became clear that my EIN was taking longer than anticipated to arrive so I checked in with the folks at Stripe, who then checked in with Rocket Lawyer - turns out any 3rd-party agent registering an EIN on behalf of someone else must do so with the IRS via fax. With the government shutdown the fax lines were also down; I suppose there was simply nobody there to pick up whatever papers were arriving at the fax machine!

Rather than wait through what was expected to be at least a multi-week delay after the government opened back up, I instead used the IRS website to apply for my EIN. It was free, took roughly 30 seconds, and the EIN document was emailed to me within a minute or two…

In my eleventh grade, I (Jeff) used to toy with various equations in physics. Out of the blue, I decided to equate the RHS of Einstein's mass energy equivalence (E = mc2) and Plank's equation (E=hv). I ended up getting an equation: λ = h/mc. Without knowing much on what the equation would mean, I thought that it connected mass and wavelength in some way.

Just a few months later, I ended up realizing in 12th grade that this is actually the de Broglie's equation on wave particle duality and the equation was derived in pretty much the same way. Although, it meant that I wasn't the first discoverer of wave particle duality, I did invariably come up with the concept unbeknownst to me that this is something that all physicists knew for many years. A discovery that I'm still proud of :)

1/ The vast majority of subscription revenue comes from people who forgot they were paying for a service and consumers’ willingness to pay for stuff is way higher than people give them credit for.

2/ Paid marketing is a *much* better channel than people give it credit for. It often costs a heck of a lot more to get word of mouth growth and “organic” growth than it does to just use FB or Google Ads for customer acquisition.

Most programmers work as w2 rather than 1099 employees because of a 1986 tax reform act that threatens to (at the IRS’s whims) tax employers as if their 1099 programmers are w2 employees. Congress suspected that programmers were using their companies as tax havens, but studies show that programmers are actually more scrupulous than average when it comes to IRS reporting. The freelance programming economy is growing in spite of this (since software is eating the world), but many companies have an institutional memory from this 1986 law (which is still a threat) and prefer w2 or c2c arrangements.

The limit of human potential is something we all underestimate. Six years ago I read the story of Pheidippides who ran from Athens to Sparta (a distance of 153 miles) to seek aid in fighting the invading Persians.

He is said to have run the distance in a day and a half or 36 hours. This run had never been replicated until 1982 when five Royal Air Force officers attempted the course. Three of them completed it, proving it could be done and the following year a competition was born.

Today the course record stands at 20 hours and 25 minutes, but it was the original story that propelled me to take up the sport of ultrarunning myself (since put on hold to focus on my startup). While I haven’t completed a 153 mile race I have competed in numerous 24 hour endurance events and 100km trail runs. Each and every time I believe I have learned something new about myself, as well as the power of perseverance and commitment to a goal or cause.

This isn’t so much amusing as it is amazing.

Many of the women I speak with about their periods tell me that their mom started them on pads… because if they used a tampon, they “wouldn’t be a virgin anymore.” Women are always surprised at themselves for saying that. I think we don’t realize that period stigma is so deeply ingrained in us.

I’m applying to YC because I miss the talent, ambition and accountability I had with my teams in the valley. It's very hard to reach great without those things or on your own. Plus, I need resources to make that happen. Bootstrapping could eventually clear the financial hurdles, but the mentorship, network and reputation that come along with Y Combinator all take too long to build on your own. It would probably take me 10 years to do on my own what I could do in 2 years working with YC.

Also the more users I talk to and research I do the more urgently I feel the need to show people what’s possible. In the beginning I just wanted to bootstrap and work on something that helped at least a few people. I was trying to be realistic and temper expectations, after all everyone thinks they want to change the world.
