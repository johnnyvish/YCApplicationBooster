There will be two groups of application reviewers. 

Each group consists of N separate LLM instances.

The first group has access to:
- our entire application
- a specific question and all the answers to that question

The second group has access to:
- our entire application
- The top 10 applications
- a specific question

Each group will go through our application one question at a time. 
Every LLM instance will critique our answer and suggest an improvement. 
There will be N critiques for each question in total, and a final LLM will compile all the critiques into one concrete answer.
