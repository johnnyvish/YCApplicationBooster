You are a expert YC application writer/editor/creator.

First, some tips on YC application:

Introduction
Twice a year Y Combinator takes applications for funding. I thought it might help applicants if I explained what we look for when we read them.
Probably the biggest thing people don’t understand about the process is the importance of expressing yourself clearly. Every year we get some applications that are obviously good, some that are obviously bad, and in the middle a huge number where we just can’t tell. The idea seems kind of promising, but it’s not explained well enough for us to understand it. The founders seem like they might be good, but we don’t get a clear enough picture of them to say for sure.

I suspect for every group we invite to interviews, there are one or two more that are just as good but that we pass over because they don’t manage to convey how good they are. If that’s true, another way to say it is that, of groups good enough to make it to interviews, more than half blow the application.

If we get 1000 applications and have 10 days to read them, we have to read about 100 a day. That means a YC partner who reads your application will on average have already read 50 that day and have 50 more to go. Yours has to stand out. So you have to be exceptionally clear and concise. Whatever you have to say, give it to us right in the first sentence, in the simplest possible terms.

All the YC partners read applications. We each do it separately, to avoid groupthink, so I’m not sure exactly what the others do, but it’s probably similar to what I do.

Matter of Fact Answers
The first question I look at is, “What is your company going to make?” This isn’t the question I care most about, but I look at it first because I need something to hang the application on in my mind.

The best answers are the most matter of fact. It’s a mistake to use marketing-speak to make your idea sound more exciting. We’re immune to marketing-speak; to us it’s just noise. 1. So don’t begin your answer with something like

We are going to transform the relationship between individuals and information.

That sounds impressive, but it conveys nothing. It could be a description of any technology company. Are you going to build a search engine? Database software? A router? I have no idea.

One test of whether you’re explaining your idea effectively is to ask how close the reader is to reproducing it. After reading that sentence I’m no closer than I was before, so its content is effectively zero. Another mistake is to begin with a sweeping introductory paragraph about how important the problem is:

Information is the lifeblood of the modern organization. The ability to channel information quickly and efficiently to those who need it is critical to a company’s success. A company that achieves an edge in the efficient use of information will, all other things being equal, have a significant edge over competitors.

Again, zero content; after reading this, the reader is no closer to reproducing your project than before. A good answer would be something like:

A database with a wiki-like interface, combined with a graphical UI for controlling who can see and edit what.

I’m not convinced yet that this will be the next Google, but at least I’m starting to engage with it. I’m thinking what such a thing would be like.

One reason founders resist giving matter-of-fact descriptions is that they seem to constrain your potential. “But it’s so much more than a database with a wiki UI!” The problem is, the less constraining your description, the less you’re saying. So it’s better to err on the side of matter-of-factness.

We advise startups presenting at Demo Day to do the same. Better to start with an overly narrow description of your project than try to describe it in its full generality and lose the audience completely. If there’s a simple one-sentence description of what you’re doing that only conveys half your potential, that’s actually pretty good. You’re halfway to your destination in just the first sentence.

One good trick for describing a project concisely is to explain it as a variant of something the audience already knows. It’s like Wikipedia, but within an organization. It’s like an answering service, but for email. It’s eBay for jobs. This form of description is wonderfully efficient. Don’t worry that it will make your idea seem “derivative.” Some of the best ideas in history began by sticking together two existing ideas no one realized could be combined.

The Founders
After spending 20 seconds or so trying to understand the idea, I skip down to look at the founders. My initial goal is to figure out what kind of group I’m dealing with.

Three friends about to graduate from college? Two colleagues who work together at a big company and want to jump ship? Are they all programmers? A mix of programmers and business people? There are maybe 20 or 30 different configurations of founders.

Once I know what type of group I have, I try to figure out how good an instance of that type it is. The most important question for deciding that is

Please tell us in one or two sentences about something impressive that each founder has built or achieved.

To me this is the most important question on the application. It’s deliberately open-ended; there’s no one type of answer we’re looking for. It could be that you did really well in school, or that you wrote a highly-regarded piece of software, or that you paid your own way through college after leaving home at 16. It’s not the type of achievement that matters so much as the magnitude. Succeeding in a startup is, in the most literal sense, extraordinary, so we’re looking for people able to do extraordinary things.

As with all questions on the application, the best answers are the most specific. A surprising number of people answer with something like:

Jordan is an exceptionally dedicated person who gives 100% effort to every project he undertakes.

This kind of generic claim carries no weight. A single, specific example would be much more convincing. You probably shouldn’t list the startup itself as your most impressive achievement. We already know you’ve created that. Why waste the opportunity to brag about something else?

If there’s no one thing about you that you feel stands out, what should you list? I’d go with whatever you’ve done that was the hardest—-preferably (though not necessarily) the hardest intellectually. It doesn’t matter if it’s not the sort of thing you’d put on a resume. We’re not looking for the same things as HR departments.

Insight
If the founders seem promising, I’ll now spend more time trying to understand the idea. I care more about the founders than the idea, because most of the startups we fund will change their idea significantly.

If a group of founders seemed impressive enough, I’d fund them with no idea. But a really good idea will also get our attention—-not because of the idea per se, but because it’s evidence the founders are smart.

Just as what we look for in founders is not the type of achievement but the magnitude, what we look for in ideas is not the type of idea but the level of insight you have about it. You’re going to start an auction site? That could be a good idea or a bad idea. What matters is how you’re going to hold your own against eBay. What’s going to be distinctive about your solution?

It’s a common mistake to say the distinctive thing about your solution will be that it’s well-designed and easy to use. That is not an insight. You’re just claiming you’re going to execute well. Whoever wrote the current software was presumably also trying to. So you have to be more specific. Exactly what are you going to do that will make your software easier to use? And will that be enough? The reason a lot of big companies’ software sucks is that they have some kind of natural monopoly. Unless you have a plan for cracking it, it won’t make any difference if yours is better.

We don’t mind if you’re doing something that will face serious obstacles. In fact, we like that. The best startup ideas are generally outliers that seem crazy to most people initially. But we want to see that you’re aware of the obstacles, and have at least a theory about how to overcome them. We’d be delighted to get an application that answered the question “What are you going to make?” with

A new search engine to compete with Google.

so long as this was followed by

We know that sounds impossible, but we think we can get a toehold initially by…

Wouldn’t you be interested at this point? Even if the plan had only a 1% chance of working, it would be worth backing. 2.

Whereas if we can see obstacles to your idea that you don’t seem to have considered, that’s a bad sign. This is your idea. You’ve had days, at least, to think about it, and we’ve only had a couple minutes. We shouldn’t be able to come up with objections you haven’t thought of.

Paradoxically, it is for this reason better to disclose all the flaws in your idea than to try to conceal them. If we think of a problem you don’t mention, we’ll assume it’s because you haven’t thought of it. And since we care more about you than the idea, it’s a mistake to risk sacrificing yourself to make the idea seem better.

Further Exploration
If the founders seem promising and the idea is interesting, I’ll now spend a lot more time on the application.

I’ll take a look at the video, if there is one. (Statistically we’re much more likely to interview people who submit a video.) I’ll check out the demo. And I’ll look at answers to some of the more mundane questions, like the stock allocation.

If the founders seem promising but the idea doesn’t, I check the question near the end that asks what other ideas the founders had. It’s quite common for us to fund groups to work on ideas they listed as alternates.

The Wildcard
There’s one question that acts like a wildcard, at least for me:

Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

If this wasn’t already clear, we’re not looking for the sort of obedient, middle-of-the-road people that big companies tend to hire. We’re looking for people who like to beat the system. So if the answer to this question is good enough, it will make me go back and take a second look at an application that otherwise seemed unpromising. In fact, I think there are people we’ve invited to interviews mainly on the strength of their answer to this question.

Help Us Out
Generally, the advice I’d give to applicants is: help us out. Investors are optimists. We want to believe you’re great. Most people you meet in everyday life don’t.

If you go around saying you’re going to start the next Google, most people’s initial reaction will be skepticism. Partly because the odds of succeeding are low, so skepticism is the safe bet, but also because most people are threatened by ambition: you seem to be trying to put yourself above them, even if that isn’t your intention.

Investors are different—-not because they’re more generous spirited than other people, but because they get equity. Tell investors you’re going to start the next Google and they immediately perk up. They don’t default to skepticism, because they like risky bets. And they don’t feel like you’re trying to put yourself above them, because they hope to be drawn up with you.

Like all investors, we want to believe. So help us believe. If there’s something about you that stands out, or some special insight you have into the problem you plan to work on, make sure we see it.

The best way to do that is simply to be concise. You don’t have to sell us on you. We’ll sell ourselves, if we can just understand you. But every unnecessary word in your application subtracts from the effect of the necessary ones. So before submitting your application, print it out and take a red pen and cross out every word you don’t need. And in what’s left be as specific and as matter-of-fact as you can.

HERE ARE THE TOP YC APPLICATIONS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO. AFTER READING THESE I WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO MY APPLICATION IDEA. YOU JOB IS TO FIX ALL THE ISSUES TO MAKE MY APPLICATION GOOD AND HELP ME GET IN.

7 EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS:

--------------------- First Application --------------------- 
--------------------- 80,000 hours.txt ---------------------
Company
What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.
We help graduates choose careers that make a difference. Currently we provide an online career guide and one-on-one coaching. In order to serve more users, we’re building a web app to automate parts of our coaching process. It will show users how to compare their options in terms of impact, and recommend high-impact paths they may not have though of. Afterwards, they'll receive personalized advice from our career coaches. Our users get the meaningful career they want, and society benefits because more talent goes to the most pressing social problems.

Founders
Please enter the url of a 1 minute unlisted (not private) YouTube video introducing the founder(s). This video is an important part of the application. (Follow the Video Guidelines.)
http://youtu.be/W3tPfpDQ-KQ
Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.
Will and I started to work together on career content the first time we met, over four years ago. Our first project was a talk on how to make the most difference with your career, which we gave as part of Will’s first charity, Giving What We Can. The first time we gave the talk, a quarter of the audience completely changed what they were planning to do with their lives. So we decided to work together some more!
The (embarrassing) original is still on youtube….https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAnh2FApskM

How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
Will and Ben met and started working together four years ago. Since then we’ve run a press campaign that was featured in the BBC, advised policy makers at the UK Prime Minister's office, fundraised hundreds of thousands of dollars, and much else.

Peter and James have both been supporters since the early days. James joined our advisory board in 2013, and we’ve finally tempted him to leave his current organisation to join us full time.

Peter joined the team as a freelancer in August 2014 as we moved our focus to online. He got so much done we quickly brought him up to full time and asked him to become a founder.

Progress
How far along are you?
We’ve written an online career guide that receives over 20,000 unique viewes monthly, up from zero in August, and up 10% over the last month. We give one-on-one advice to 5-10 people per month to figure out what users most want, and so far have advised over 200.

We’ve tracked over 170 significant career shifts due to our advice. Previous users have founded 5 new non-profits and collectively donated over $1m to high-impact charities. Others have started political careers or entered high-impact research fields such as AGI safety.
See examples here:
https://80000hours.org/about/impact/studies-of-career-change/

Last month, we released a prototype web app to automate the first stages of our one-on-one advice. The first version was seen by 225 uniques and had 11 sign ups over a week, with an average revenue of $25 per person. It cut time per user served by 70%, and 40% of users said they changed their career plans.

How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
We started working as volunteers in November 2011. Since July 2012, we’ve had about three full-time staff on the project. The latest version of our website has 20,000 lines of code and our prototype app has 700.

Which of the following best describes your progress?
Launched
Do you have revenue?
Yes
How much revenue?
Since 2012, we’ve raised over $700,000 in donations. Of this, about 30% comes from 20 former users. Our donors fund us in order to place more people in high-impact career paths. Historically, we’ve been able to raise $1500 per significant career shift. We’ve also started to charge users for one-on-one advice. Last month we earned about $1000.
What is your monthly growth rate?
~10% (website uniques)
If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
Winter 2014.

Team: Added a hacker, Peter Hartree, and a hustler, James Norris.
Traction: 173 significant plan changes vs. 20 previously.
Product: Created a 40 page online career guide and prototype web app.
Domain expertise: Have coached another 100+ people, further testing our key content.
Distribution: Will secured a $150,000 book deal with Penguin and a column in Vox.com. The book is finished and will be published in August 2015.

Idea
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
Why this idea?
It’s the advice we wish we’d had. When we graduated we wanted to use our careers to make a difference. But we couldn’t find any useful advice on what to do. So we did the research and created our own advice. People listened, totally changed their plans, and became fanatical supporters: e.g. we’ve been approached by users who want to run groups promoting us at Cambridge, Harvard, UPenn, Princeton, Bain and elsewhere. We’ve helped spark a whole new social movement: Effective Altruism.

Domain expertise
We’ve spent over three years doing systematic research into how to make the biggest difference with your career, and advised over 200 people. As far as we know, no-one else has worked on this question as much as us.

Why will this work?
31% of graduates say making an impact in their work is “essential”, but they have little idea what to do except work in the social sector or give up (“sell out”). So most of their potential for impact is wasted.

We’ve shown we can solve this problem for an extremely valuable niche: we’re advising some of the most talented young people in America and the UK, and enabling them to have far more impact. By improving our web app, we can serve a much larger audience. We can distribute widely by releasing engaging content: Will has a Vox.com column and a $150,000 book deal with Penguin (already finished, to be released August ‘15).

What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
We’re the only organisation in the world that uses in-depth research to help people choose careers that make a difference.

Most career advice doesn’t focus on social impact. When it does, it’s based on anecdote rather than research, and usually confined to one narrow approach e.g. just the charity sector. This means it can’t help you with the big decisions that really matter, like PhD vs. startup vs. Teach for America. Instead, when it comes to these decisions, our audience must put together their own makeshift guidance from friends, mentors and family.

Equity
Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?
Yes
What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?
Charitable company, formed in the UK.

List any investments your company has received. Include the name of the investor, the amount invested, the premoney valuation / valuation cap, and the type of security sold (convertible notes, safes or stock).
Incorporated in 23 Feb 2012 in the UK.

$700,000 of donations since 2012, primarily from 25 individual donors. Of this we’ve spent about $400,000.

Donors who have given over $10,000 include: Jaan Tallinn (cofounder of Skype), Allan Gray (founder of Orbis), Luke Ding (former hedge fund manager at Brevan Howard), Tony Purnell (entrepreneur and Professor of Engineering at Cambridge), and three former users.

Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.
We’re fiscally sponsored by the Centre for Effective Altruism. It provides our 501(c)(3) status and incorporation, as well as some of our operations.

Others
If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
No

Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
The eradication of smallpox in 1973 has saved five times more lives than world peace since that time would have done.

Even if we assume that all foreign aid was completely wasted except insofar as it caused the eradication of smallpox, it would still have saved a life for every $40,000 spent.

Curious
What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?
After three years in research mode, we want to scale massively. We’ve spent some time in the Bay and feel there’s a lot we could learn from other startups and the tech startup scene. We think our approach to making a difference is aligned with Y Combinator: go with the numbers and maximise scale.

How did you hear about Y Combinator?
When researching how to go into tech entrepreneurship. When the non-profit program was released, lots of our users sent it to us.
--------------------- Next Application --------------------- 
--------------------- Cruise.txt ---------------------
Company
What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.
Cruise builds a system that inexpensively turns your car into a self‑driving vehicle.

We constrain the problem by using commodity hardware, proven algorithms and only solving 90% of driving scenarios‑‑we still leave the trickiest 10% up to you.

The product is an aftermarket add‑on for certain vehicles that bolts on like a roof rack. It contains cameras, radar, GPS, and other sensors, and we plan to build these at a cost of under $3,000 per unit.
Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?
SF.

jebagu: I helped to build a self‑driving car. My team finished alongside Stanford and Carnegie Mellon to finish the 2007 Grand Challenge: http://www.graymatterinc.com/. Networked my way into Founder's Fund F50, reportedly the most exclusive tech conference ever.
Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
Due to a weird California law, I couldn't apply for a real estate license since I dropped out of MIT and hadn't earned a college degree. I was told I'd need to earn my degree or spend two years as an apprentice. Neither of those options worked for me since I was busy with Justin.tv.

So, I found a way to get a brand new Bachelor's degree by spending just four weeks on actual coursework. I now hold a degree in Information Technology (basically just how to install Windows).

The loophole was to use a competency‑based online university (take the test, pass the class, repeat) rather than a semester‑based university.

Amusing side note: I am both an MIT dropout and a college graduate.
How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
We met in early October 2013 after being introduced by Danielle Fong (Chief Scientist, LightSail Energy).
If we fund you, which of the founders will commit to working exclusively (no school, no other jobs) on this project for the next year?
All of them.
Do any founders have other commitments between X and Y inclusive?
No.
Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g. finishing college, going to grad school), and if so what?
No.
Progress
How far along are you?
In our first two weeks, we've already met with many of the smartest people in the industry to learn everything we can about what's already been done. We've acquired an Audi S4 (has electromechanical steering + looks cool) to use as our demo car, and have started fitting it with cameras and drive‑by‑wire equipment.

We hope to have a demo ready it by Demo Day, but it will be just a demo. We are not launched, and don't plan to until after raising much more money. This is a capital‑intensive business.
How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
We have been working for about two weeks (started roughly mid October).
Idea
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
Self‑driving car technology has so many positive effects on society that it sounds absurd when you start to list them (but I will anyway). It can reduce carbon emissions and oil consumption, unluck billions of hours of lost productivity, save hundreds of billions of dollars lost due to auto accidents, and save tens of thousands of lives. I can't think of many other ways to have this kind of impact on the world.

We have both built self‑driving cars before. Kyle built a wifi‑controlled Ford F‑150 at MIT. Jeremy built the LIDAR sensor systems for Graymatter Inc, the first company ever to raise venture capital to build self driving cars. We personally know many of the smartest people working on this stuff (it's a small circle) and we will get them on our team.

People want this technology. A study by KPMG shows car buyers are willing to pay a 20‑25% premium for a vehicle that can drive itself. But people also really *need* this technology. One million people are injured in car accdients in the US every year and 33,000 of them don't survive. 90% of those accidents can be attributed to driver error, so this technology will save thousands of lives.
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
1) It costs at least an order of magnitude less than what is being built today.
2) It's designed to work on existing cars.

Americans drive 37 miles per day on average. They sometimes drive while texting, drive while intoxicated, or simply drive while being distracted. People seem to be trying really hard to do other things instead of driving, but so far there aren't many good ways to accomplish this.

Some newer vehicles have advanced cruise control systems that keep the vehicle in the lane during ideal highway driving situations, but drivers aren't supposed to do anything else or even take their eyes off the road. This seems like a band‑aid solution.
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
Google currently has the most impressive self‑driving cars. Elon Musk has announced Tesla's plans to have cars that drive 90% of the time in 3 years. Most major auto manufacturers have already demonstrated self‑driving R&D prototypes and have partnered with various universities. OEM's like Bosch and Continental have large teams working on self‑driving technology that could end up in future generations of new cars.

We are most afraid of Google. Their systems potentially have access to Streetview and Maps data, which is extremely hard to replicate. Their current technology is too expensive to sell directly to consumers, and their commercialization strategy is unclear, but those things could change very quickly.
What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
1) First‑mover in this market will gain a large advantage in datasets, maps and branding. We aim to be that first mover.

2) The best way to differentiate a car is with new technology (like self‑driving systems). Existing car companies are adept at charging more money for leather and chrome, but that approach is pretty much dead.
How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
We will make money by selling and installing our equipment on existing vehicles. Over time, more of our revenue will come from subscriptions fees.

J.D. Power surveyed 17,000 drivers in 2012 and found that 20% would"probably" or "definitely" buy self‑driving technology in their next vehicle at an estimated market price of $3k.

If that survey is even remotely representative of the rest of the country, those drivers who are ready to buy today will create at least a $100 billion market in the US alone.
How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
There's already quite a bit of buzz around self‑driving cars, but nothing is on the market yet. This has created an enormous $100 billion shadow demand that we'll tap into once we launch.
Equity
What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?
Cruise Automation, Inc. is a Delaware C corp created in September 2013.
Please describe the breakdown of the equity ownership in percentages among the founders, employees and any other stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the equity ownership of each founder.
50/50 split between Kyle and Jeremy. $100K convertible note from Kyle.
Legal
Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.
No.
Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
No (it was not done by a non-founder)
Others
If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
Turbotax for mortgages
DNS for snail mail
Github for CAD
Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
I spent a week as a tourist in Iceland and never had to touch a piece of physical currency. It was amazing. Everyone took debit cards.

Yet I still have to fumble through my pocket for some wadded up dollar bills to get across the Bay Bridge.

--------------------- Dropbox.txt ---------------------
Company
If you have a demo, what's the url? Demo can be anything that shows us how the product works. Usually that's a video or screen recording.
Here's a screencast that I'll also put up on news.yc: http://www.getdropbox.com/screencast/ If you do have a Windows box or two, here's the latest build: http://www.getdropbox.com/u/2/DropboxInstaller.exe
What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.
Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team's computers. It's much better than uploading or email, because it's automatic, integrated into Windows, and fits into the way you already work. There's also a web interface, and the files are securely backed up to Amazon S3. Dropbox is kind of like taking the best elements of subversion, trac and rsync and making them "just work" for the average individual or team. Hackers have access to these tools, but normal people don't. It's currently in private beta and I add batches of people every few days.

There are lots of interesting possible features. One is syncing Google Docs/Spreadsheets (or other office web apps) to local .doc and .xls files for offline access, which would be strategically important as few web apps deal with the offline problem.
Founders
Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.

For fun last summer reverse engineered the software on a number of poker sites and wrote a real-money playing poker bot (it was about break-even; see screenshot url later in the app.)
How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
There's a joke in here somewhere.
If we fund you, which of the founders will commit to working exclusively (no school, no other jobs) on this project for the next year?
Drew
Do any founders have other commitments between X and Y inclusive?
No; I'm leaving Bit9 in a few weeks to work on this full time regardless of YC funding.
Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g. finishing college, going to grad school), and if so what?
No. Probably moving to SF in September
Progress
How far along are you?
Prototype - done in Feb. Beta - in people's hands now. Version I can charge for: 6-8 weeks?
How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
3 months part time. About ~5KLOC client and ~2KLOC server of python, C++, Cheetah templates, installer scripts, etc.
Idea
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
Most small teams have a few basic needs: (1) team members need their important stuff in front of them wherever they are, (2) everyone needs to be working on the latest version of a given document (and ideally can track what's changed), (3) and team data needs to be protected from disaster. There are sync tools (e.g. beinsync, Foldershare), there are backup tools (Carbonite, Mozy), and there are web uploading/publishing tools (box.net, etc.), but there's no good integrated solution.

Dropbox solves all these needs, and doesn't need configuration or babysitting. Put another way, it takes concepts that are proven winners from the dev community (version control, changelogs/trac, rsync, etc.) and puts them in a package that my little sister can figure out (she uses Dropbox to keep track of her high school term papers, and doesn't need to burn CDs or carry USB sticks anymore.)

At a higher level, online storage and local disks are big and cheap. But the internet links in between have been and will continue to be slow in comparison. In "the future", you won't have to move your data around manually. The concept that I'm most excited about is that the core technology in Dropbox -- continuous efficient sync with compression and binary diffs -- is what will get us there.
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
Carbonite and Mozy do a good job with hassle-free backup, and a move into sync would make sense. Sharpcast (venture funded) announced a similar app called Hummingbird, but according to Jeff (who is good friends with the tech lead) they're taking an extraordinarily difficult approach involving NT kernel drivers. Google's coming out with GDrive at some point. Microsoft's Groove does sync and is part of Office 2007, but is very heavyweight and doesn't include any of the web stuff or backup. There are apps like Omnidrive and Titanize but the implementations are buggy or have bad UIs.
What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
Competing products work at the wrong layer of abstraction and/or force the user to constantly think and do things. The "online disk drive" abstraction sucks, because you can't work offline and the OS support is extremely brittle. Anything that depends on manual emailing/uploading (i.e. anything web-based) is a non-starter, because it's basically doing version control in your head. But virtually all competing services involve one or the other.

With Dropbox, you hit "Save", as you normally would, and everything just works, even with large files (and binary diffs ensure that only the changed portions go over the wire).
How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
The current plan is a freemium approach, where we give away free 1GB accounts and charge for additional storage (maybe ~$5/mo or less for 10GB for individuals and team plans that start at maybe $20/mo.). It's hard to get consumers to pay for things, but fortunately small/medium businesses already pay for solutions that are subsets of what Dropbox does and are harder to use. There will be tiered pricing for business accounts (upper tiers will retain more older versions of documents, have branded extranets for secure file sharing with clients/partners, etc., and an 'enterprise' plan that features, well, a really high price.)

I've already been approached by potential partners/customers asking for a web services API to programmatically create Dropboxes (e.g. to handle file sharing for Assembla.com, a web site for managing global dev teams). There's a natural synergy between project mgmt/groupware web apps (which do to-do lists, calendaring, etc. well but not files) and Dropbox for file sharing. I've also had requests for an enterprise version that would sit on a company's network (as opposed to my S3 store) for which I could probably charge a lot.

If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
One click screen sharing (already done pretty well by Glance); a wiki with version-controlled drawing canvases that let you draw diagrams or mock up UIs (Thinkature is kind of related, but this is more text with canvases interspersed than a shared whiteboard) to help teams get on the same page and spec things out better (we use Visio and Powerpoint at Bit9, which suck for working collaboratively); some ideas surrounding better web analytics for newbies
Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
The ridiculous things people name their documents to do versioning, like "proposal v2 good revised NEW 11-15-06.doc", continue to crack me up.

How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
In 2011 Dmitriy started GitLab. We met in 2012 via email when Sytse started building GitLab.com. In 2013 we formally started a company together and went on team trips a few times since than.
Progress
How far along are you?
Over 100.000 organizations are using GitLab. , Qualcomm, NASA, Nasdaq OMX and Interpol are paying customers. Over 600 people have contributed to it. It is the most popular open source version control software. It has more installations than anything else (including GitHub Enterprise and Atlassian Stash).

We have not applied to or participated any others.
Idea
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
Dmitriy wanted a solution he could use at his previous job. All employees except our account managers (8-2=6) are software developers. We listen closely to the community via direct customer feedback, pull/merge requests, issues, twitter, mailinglists, chatrooms and the non GitLab B.V. employees on the GitLab core team.
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
We offer the a better way of collaborating on digital products ( the feature branch workflow) to organizations that prefer to work on open source tools. Open source is interesting for large companies because they can inspect and modify the code. They also can and do contribute back changes that are important to them. Substitutes are closed source alternatives (GitHub Enterprise, Atlassian Stash) or less functional open source alternatives (Gitorious, Gogs). GitHub currently has a lot of mind-share but they are under- serving the on-premises (behind the firewall) market. We can see us grow into the leading solution for those installations (which is currently the majority of the market). In the long run most software will live on some (hybrid-)cloud and we think there are many ways to differentiate our offering (open source/distributed/integrated). In the short term we are emulating the Netflix strategy, shipping DVD’s (focus on the on-premise installations) when the competitors focus on the video-on-demand (SaaS) offering.
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
GitHub Enterprise and Atlassian Stash are our primary competitors. We fear Atlassian Stash most since the GitHub Enterprise offering is weak (black box VM that doesn’t scale or cluster) and overpriced (4x more expensive than Stash or our standard subscription). We compete with Stash on usability, integration (no need to install Jira and Confluence separately), flexibility (you can inspect and adapt the source) and price.
What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
An open source development process allows you to market your product for free. It also allows a good product market fit at a low cost. We believe that version control is infrastructure software and that open source is the natural model for this kind of software . But to create and grow a competitive open source offering you need to have a proprietary commercial version to generate scalable revenue, support income alone is not enough.
How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
Mostly by selling subscriptions that entitle our customers to support and our proprietary GitLab Enterprise Edition. Our most sold subscription by revenue costs $49 per user per year. Most or our revenue comes from organizations with more than 100 paying users. Every company with a substantial number of developers needs software like ours. We already declined an acquisition offer from a competitor for $10M because we want to grow this into a large company.
How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
Currently we get users through word of mouth (amplified by twitter). During our time at YC we would like to grow our marketing, our continuous integration product GitLab CI and our SaaS (GitLab.com). GitLab.com currently has only 15k monthly active users but we see a lot of possibilities to grow and differentiate it.

Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.
Recently we’ve been working on a music search and on-demand streaming site called SongRaptor (http://songraptor.com). We built it to use as a case study for Mixpanel; we use Mixpanel for all the metrics and we’ve been making design decisions based on this data. Eventually we hope to show the effect that Mixpanel metrics can have on the growth of a site.

We haven’t gotten much farther than the most basic functionality yet. We’ve been spending most of our time on Mixpanel while our other friends continue development.

Please tell us in one or two sentences about something impressive that each founder has built or achieved.
Suhail participated in OpenSocial while it was bleeding edge, developed an application that got over 1 MM installs, and an opensource javascript framework used by recognized application companies such as Serious Business w/ over 300+ downloads.

Tim scored in the top 1% for the PSAT/SAT and became a National Merit Scholar. ASU offered him a full scholarship, and he followed the money.

Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
Last summer I managed to get an internship at Slide, but a month after accepting their offer I decided I wanted more hourly pay. Before I even started at Slide, I was able to convince the recruiter that I had numerous offers still outstanding from companies like RockYou and Zynga and had in-depth OpenSocial experience that was deserving of a $10/hr raise. Luckily, she was able to get it and pay was very good that summer.

How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
I’ve known Tim for just over a year. We were in the same discrete math class, and I noticed that there were quite a few smart CS types and thought that we should get something going. After class one day I introduced myself to them and suggested we could do a startup. Then everyone expressed interest, but only Tim followed up. Since then we’ve been hanging out and talking about startups.

Tim went to Singapore to study last semester, and when he got back I pitched Mixpanel to him. He was interested and I wanted a cofounder so I brought him on board.

If we fund you, which of the founders will commit to working exclusively (no school, no other jobs) on this project for the next year?
Both Tim and I are committed to working exclusively for the next year with some path of success in sight.

Do any founders have other commitments between X and Y inclusive?
We have no commitments between that period and are free to start mid May.

Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g. finishing college, going to grad school), and if so what?
We’ve invested three years into college so far, but we are willing to take a leave of absence to pursue this startup. We’re entering a market where we can be a serious competitor and we have to move now.

Progress
When will you have a prototype or beta?
We currently already have a alpha build with a variety of clients saying they will or have integrated including some YCombinator companies: Posterous, TicketStumbler, and HeyZap. A beta will likely be finished either before summer starts or soon during. Our alpha version is already earning revenue at a profit and we are working on stream-lining this process.

Idea
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
Mixpanel is going to bring the competitive advantage data-driven companies like Facebook and Slide have to everyone. Instead of just tracking page views and referrals, Mixpanel will let people learn about their customers by tracking interactions and engagement. We’re also going to help them identify and track their conversion funnels — the paths visitors take to registrations, purchases or any other goal page designated by the company.

Today, companies have to spend their most scarce resources, time and money, to build out internal analytic systems specific to their application. These homebrew systems are less robust and insightful than the service we are offering.

Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
Our primary competitor is Google Analytics. Many of the inquiries we receive ask “How are you different from GA?” and a successful solution has been to explicitly say what we offer and how we are different from the beginning. We fear Google the most because of their market penetration and their engineering resources.

Aside from Google, there are a few other companies entering this market: nuconomy, KISSmetrics, Aster Data, and Gumtrail.

What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
Working at Slide, known for being data-driven, inspired me to build Mixpanel. While at Slide, I got to work closely with Max Levchin on a specific product where he helped teach me how to truly build and iterate data-driven products from the start.

Mixpanel was conceived from the ground up with companies like Slide in mind as well as the problems people there had to face letting us offer a more compelling solution. We can really say, we’re building an analytics platform the way large data-driven companies expect it to be.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
Mixpanel’s business model is a subscription based freemium model. Based on the data logged and analyzed we can scale prices based solely on usage similar to that of Amazon S3.

Our idea is to target small under-served startups before they build out an internal system. During that period, we aim to help, consult, build case studies, and provide a free trial to augment our brand and reputation before targeting larger potential clients.

Equity
Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?
No

Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.
No to both questions.

All code written thus far is safe to use based on the licensing.

By the last application, it was just a prototype, now we’re already running live transactions and we’ve released additional libraries.

Idea
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
When i founded my first startup in 2010, we needed a way to accept payments online, there was no solution locally, we had to work around using Avangate BV and creating accounts in the UK. 5 years later, there’s still no easy way.

I spent the entire 2014 implementing payments and disbursement solutions for Banks and i realized that most of the infrastructure needed to build a full stack payments API already existed, and it just needed someone to do the hardwork of putting it all together and doing all that is necessary. I finished the engagement in Nov. 2014 and immediately created Paystack.

The demand for Paystack is amazing, we haven’t done any PR or Marketing and we’re growing our waiting list at 10x monthly, just from word of mouth. I’ve personally spoken to over 150 merchants and everyone is excited and waiting. Our pilot merchants need it so much that they started using it without a settlement system, so they did not mind leaving their money with us for over 6 weeks.

What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
What’s new? In Nigeria.. there’s still no way to accept recurring payments or one click payments. The incumbents are big co’s owned by banks and are not interested in innovating.

Substitutes, creating US or UK companies so they can use UK or US payment processors and then find ways to send the money back.

Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
We have 3 types of competitors: (1) Local Financial Institutions (2) Global Payment cos and (3) Local non-Financial Institutions

Local FI’s are not able to progress because they mostly buy white label solutions. No incremental progress or problem-solving.

Global companies like Stripe and Braintree are competitors but it will be difficult for them to meet the needs of the African Merchants. It’s easy for them to offer Bitcoin or Apple Pay integration but what about Verve Cards (a pan African card scheme), or Mobile Money or other local card schemes?

Local Non FI’s are the real competition, but we believe that as long as we focus on solving the merchant’s needs we will continue to grow our business.

What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
Well, we’re firstly developers, then business owners, and merchants so we can feel the pain from a developer and merchant perspective. every other person right now seems to be more interested in their vested interests.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
Transaction fees. 1.9% + 50cents

How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
We’re already getting users by word of mouth. We’re active in the local developer community, we’ll reach out to merchants directly, and we’ll signup merchants via integration with existing services (Shopify, eventbrite, woocommerce) Our banking partner has also asked that we onboard thousands of Merchants that are their customers.

TLDR: During university we made £14,000 in revenue and over £5,000 profit in just 5 days! selling Breaking Bad Halloween costumes.

The Story

As sad as we were that Breaking Bad show was coming to an end, we also saw it as an opportunity to cash in on some extra cash.

We realised that the show was ending right before Halloween, so it was obvious to us that there would be a huge demand for breaking bad Halloween costumes due to the shows immense popularity.

We sold each costume on a 5 day lead time but bought everything on next day delivery. This meant we never held any stock and never had to make upfront investments into stock, perfect for students.

We sold the costumes on a one-page website, eBay and Etsy. Unfortunately, we had to stop selling the costumes a little early as there were very little yellow chemical grade hazmat suits left in the UK.

We have known each other for more than 6 years. And we met, well... we met online (and no! Itwasn't Tinder).

We were participating in an online hackathon and started chatting about ideas and projects in an online chat before deciding to meet up and talk in person as both happened to live nearby.

We later realised that we are both are driven and ambitious, get along really well and have complementary sets of skills in design, branding, marketing and development. We started as partners, building a fun project to test our compatibility, but it was not until we both left university that we decided to start a startup full time.

How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
In total, we have been working on this for just over a year.

However, we have been working on this exact iteration of the product for the last 5 months after pivoting into the current iteration.

The first 9 months were spent experimenting with different ideas, getting the feel for the market, iterating and testing MVP's and getting feedback from our users. Everything we have learnt in the first 9 months helped us get to where we are today.

We are currently completely bootstrapped and have been working evenings and weekends while contracting for the last 5 month. As of April 2019 we are both moving back into working on VEED full time, with another 8 months of runway and lots of interest from potential investors.

Are people using your product?
Yes
Do you have revenue?
No

Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
I (Sabba) was working as a contractor for googles production agency in London. I was asked by the marketing department to crop a video and add text to it for Instagram.

The marketing department was more than capable creatively to do the task themselves but did not have the right laptops to run video editing software and were intimidated by the software available.

A quick google search later we found there that there was a clear need for the product. Deeper research demonstrated that there was a lot of searching for online editing tools with little to no web tools. The tools available were outdated and not up to scratch.

What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
We are a fully fledged online video editing platform designed for marketers and content creator. To use it, you don't need to download anything, you don't need to signup and we don't add
watermarks.

Without us, users have to turn to a fragmented ecosystem of paid and free mobile apps and updated web tools to get their job done. Or, alternatively, they have to download and learn how to use complex editing platforms, such as Final Cut Pro and Adobe After Effects.

Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
Our competitors are Kapwing, Adobe, Apple. I don't think startups should have a fear of competition. We are focusing on making a great product for our users and will evolve our offering overtime to meet their needs.

What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
They don't understand that video editing platforms where designed for editing films and tv shows, not 10-second clips for Instagram & Twitter. This is further supported by the rising community of young content creators using platforms such as TikTok.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
We will have a freemium offering.

Users will pay for better quality exports and more tools.

We think we will have a low conversion rate to paid at the start.

Now I don't like projecting crazy numbers because it is to easy to say with little consequence but here goes.

We think we can grow to address 5,00,000 users monthly in the next 2 years with 1% paying $20 a month making $12,000,000 in revenue annually.

In the next 6 years, I believe we build the company to $50m revenue annually thought enterprise and education offerings and developing new products.

How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
Our primary acquisition strategy is to continue to acquire users through search and to date this accounts for 75% of our traffic. Over 500,000 people search for online video editing tools each month and we want to capture as much of that market as possible. Our platform naturally performs really well due to having a high session duration and extremely low bounce rate.

Equity
Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?
Yes
What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?
LTD - United Kingdom

Please describe the breakdown of the equity ownership in percentages among the founders, employees and any other stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the equity ownership of each founder.
Sabba Keynejad - Co-founder - CEO - 50% Equity ownership
Tim Mamadov - Co-founder - CTO - 50% Equity ownership

We also plan to create a 20% equity pool for early hires with 10% taken from both co-founders.

Have you taken any investment yet?
No
Legal
Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.
N/A

Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
We both write code, but Sabba focuses on growth, marketing and design. Tim writes most of our front end and back end code. Maté Nagy is an amazing freelancer who works part-time with us and focuses on our render engine and graphics programming.

Is there anything else we should know about your company?
We have had some tough times, but have always gotten through!

Others
If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
No, we think there is a lot of opportunity in our current idea and look forward to developing new tools under the same company. Such a live video editing platform for streamers, VR & AR Editing..

Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
There was more time between the Stegosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus Rex than between Tyrannosaurus Rex and you right now.

Curious
What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?
We want to grow like a YC company and want to learn and contribute to the extended Y Combinator family.

How did you hear about Y Combinator?
Its well known in the startup community, we also did summer school last year

Accomplishments
Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
I was an early adopter of OpenAI's GPT-2 and GPT-3 models (well before ChatGPT was released). When I realized that GPT could do most of the college writing assignments, I saw the opportunity to offer essay writing services to my friends for cheap. Little did they know, I would use GPT to do 90% of the work. Through this I made approx. $2000 doing barely anything.
Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.
I successfully completed a triple major (Physics, Statistics, Computer Science + philosophy minor) during my 4 years at uni.
Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.
I built (with Johnny):  1. Citebot, RAG-LLM tool that answers medical questions with citations using RAG. https://citebot.vercel.app/  2. Chat Audio, an AI music making tool. https://www.chataudio.com/  3. Look up, a website inspired by the movie don't look up that shows the effect of climate change using a meteor hitting our planet as a metaphor. https://lookup.vercel.app/   I built (at Deloitte):  1. TSA Answer Engine: RAG-LLM tool, sold to TSA (handshake agreement) for $9 million.  2. SOP Updater: AI agent that edits internal government documents based on new policies. 3. Aries Bot: internal LLM tool to help speed up new hire onboarding using RAG.

Accomplishments
Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
In the summer of '21, while working as a lifeguard, my pay depended on my hours. This was tracked by a timesheet app using my phone's location. I hacked my phone to spoof my location, allowing me to clock in earlier and out later, earning an extra hour each shift. By the end of summer, I made an additional $700, helping me buy a car to commute to college.
Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.
My previous startup, ChatAudio helped people with no musical experience make music using natural language prompts.
Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.
I built (with Ak):  CiteBot used RAG LLM's to conduct realtime medical research based on user's queries. (https://citebot.vercel.app).  ChatAudio used A.I to generate music, sound effects and piano covers. ( https://www.chataudio.com ).  LookUp was an ideation attempt to communicate the severity of climate change through an interactive 3D meteor impact ( https://lookup.vercel.app ).  I built (alone):  An A.I that detects violence in surveillance video footage with over 95% accuracy.
List any entrepreneurship programs or clubs you have participated in or are currently participating in.
I was a member of the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club for two years in HS.

Q: How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
A: We've known each other for 2 years. We met in college in a deep learning class and have worked on multiple projects together (including a previous startup!).

Q: Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
A: Johnny writes most of the code. Ak is also technical but focuses on sales + suppliers.

Q: Company name
A: Red Sync

Q: Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.
A: Prevent metabolic diseases using cheap biosensors.

Q: Company URL, if any
A: https://www.theredsync.com/

Q: Please provide a link to the product, if any.
A: https://testflight.apple.com/join/wwHvnT3H

Q: If login credentials are required for the link above, enter them here.
A: INVITE CODE: "TEST"

Q: What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.
A: We sell a kit of biosensors that measure your body weekly and sync with our app. Our AI analyzes your data, calls you, and provides coaching each week. This helps reduce your risk of metabolic diseases over time.

Q: Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?
A: Monroe Township (NJ), USA / San Francisco, USA

Q: Explain your decision regarding location.
A: We want to be surrounded by other motivated founders.

Q: How far along are you?
A: We have 10 paid users using our private beta app. For the weekly measurements, we drive to our user's homes once each week and manually measure them using the single set of sensors we own. We have a prototype smart-ring that we're 30% done integrating with the app.

Q: How do users find your product? How did you get the users you have now? If you run paid ads, what is your cost of acquisition?
A: At the moment, we talk to people in our local friend/family circle and ask them if they are interested in this product. All the current users were recruited this way. To keep them from saying yes prematurely, we didn't charge them the first month, and asked them if this is a service they would pay for. They all said yes.

Q: How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
A: We started 5 months ago. 3.5 months ago, Johnny went full-time. I (Ak) have a full-time job but I'm efficient with my work so I only end up working12-16 hrs/week for my job. The rest (including weekends) are spent on Red Sync.

Q: What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product?
A: NodeJS, MongoDB, React-Native, React.

Q: Are people using your product?
A: Yes

Q: How many active users or customers do you have? How many are paying? Who is paying you the most, and how much do they pay you?
A: We have 10 users, paying $30/month. (Side Note: In our founder video we mention having 8 users but since shooting we're at 10.)

Q: Do you have revenue?
A: Yes

Q: Where does your revenue come from? If your revenue comes from multiple sources (ex. multiple products, multiple companies or a mix of consulting and this product), please break down how much is coming from each source.
A: We have a monthly subscription which accounts for all our revenue.

Q: Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?
A: Monthly Growth Rate: 50%. MRR: $270. Total Revenue: $390

Q: If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
A: We applied to the last YC batch as "ChatSynth," building an AI music making tool. While all our users found our tool to be "cool", not one found it to be useful. So, we stopped. We learnt that we needed to solve a real problem people have as opposed to building a solution in search of a problem.

Q: If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.
A: N/A

Q: Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
A: I (Ak) gained weight last year and had high A1C scores, indicating a risk for diabetes. When I couldn't find an affordable solution to help reduce my risk, I talked to my friends/family. All of them agreed this was a real issue. More importantly, all of them expressed that if I found a cheap solution, they would buy it. I did not find a solution. I asked Johnny if we could build one. So, we did, and now we have 9 paid users, all of whom are those same friends/family who expressed this need. We don't have expertise but the alarming rise in metabolic diseases keeps us motivated to build an affordable solution.

Q: Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
A: We have two camps of competitors. Daily trackers, like Oura and Whoop, excel in hardware-software integration but lack a specific focus on improving metabolic health. Metabolic trackers, like Ultrahuman and Levels are effective but depend on continuous glucose monitors. This makes them cost $300/mo. We cost $35/mo. By using affordable sensors and some clever statistical algorithms, we can help predict and prevent metabolic diseases for much cheaper. Plus, we offer an AI that calls and coaches users weekly. This makes it easier to understand your data and stay accountable- something our competitors don't offer.

Q: How do or will you make money? How much could you make? We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.
A: We make money by selling a monthly subscription: $35/mo. or $399/yearly (current users pay $30/mo.). At scale, our cost per sensor kit is $122 (based on official quotes by suppliers) + $75 for yearly OpenAI calls. Eventually we plan to also sell the same product to also help manage (as opposed to prevent) metabolic diseases. According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 537 million adults were living with diabetes in 2021, and this number is expected to rise to almost 643 million by 2030. The market for preventing and managing metabolic diseases is substantial and rapidly expanding. If we capture even a small fraction of this market, the financial upside is significant.

Q: How do users find your product? How did you get the users you have now? If you run paid ads, what is your cost of acquisition?
A: At the moment, we talk to people in our local friend/family circle and ask them if they are interested in this product. All the current users were recruited this way. To keep them from saying yes prematurely, we didn't charge them the first month, and asked them if this is a service they would pay for. They all said yes.

Q: Where will most of your initial users be located?
A: US

Q: Which category best applies to your company?
A: Wellness

Q: If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
A: We're super focused on Red Sync.

Q: Have you formed ANY legal entity yet? This may be in the US, in your home country, or in another country.
A: No

Q: If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g. CEO). (This question is as much for you as us.)
A: Akshaj - CEO, 50% Johnny - CTO, 50%

Q: Have you taken any investment yet?
A: No

Q: Are you currently fundraising?
A: No

Q: What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?
A: The Paul Graham essays. We have not been to any YC events yet.

Q: How did you hear about Y Combinator?
A: Johnny heard about YC from Ak. Ak found YC on google years ago.
