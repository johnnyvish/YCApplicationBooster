One Month Rails (One Month)
S13
Successful
I've been working on a web app since November and `rake stats` shows me 615 lines of code and 415 lines of test code.

How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so, how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If so, how much? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in users or revenue or both)?

The web app is live – it allows users to sign up to access videos, lecture notes, tracks progress and generates certificates – and serves around 500 unique users per day.
As we're still bootstrapping, all of our users come in and pay through other educational platforms like Skillshare, Udemy, General Assembly, and
Appsumo.
Upcoming features include payment processing through the app, multiple paths to build different kinds of apps, and the ability to see progress on a user-by-user basis.

So far over 6,000 users have paid between $20-50 each to sign up and the feedback is incredibly positive.
We've generated over $80,000 in revenue with almost no cost. When we opened up the most recent class, 3,000 paid users signed up in two weeks (40% growth week over week versus previously).

Circles

MakeGamesWithUs (Make School)
W12
Successful
As of October 2011, we have:
-Begun contacting solo developers of promising but ugly existing apps on the app
store.
-Begun contacting artists willing to work with these developers for free and
share revenue.
-Begun development of a very simple game that we will publish with and without high-quality graphics, so we can accurately measure the impact of production value on sales.

By December, without needing to build to full site, we will have tested the
essence of our site: matching talented engineers with talented artists,
publishing the results, and taking a share of the revenue.

The Muse

Successful
Our beta site is up and running at http://www.thedailymuse.com with a minimum viable product based on attracting the userbase necessary to hit the ground running with our job products.

Mattermark (Referly)
S12

We've been working on this for about 3 weeks, most of the research is in spreadsheets rather than code at this point. We've written 663 lines of code for scrapers and crawlers to pull various data and process
it.

Standard Treasury
S13
Successful
Pre-development. We've incorporated. I'm still at Stripe. Dan's still at Giftly. It didn't make sense to start until one of the banks signalled a willingness to sign a commercial agreement as their was nothing to integrate with. Ready to start now. Raising money because of non-trivial commercial and regulatory costs. Far along with recruiting the rest of the early team and considering raising a seed round.

VEED
S19
Unsuccessful
In total, we have been working on this for just over a year.

However, we have been working on this exact iteration of the product for the last 5 months after pivoting into the current iteration.

The first 9 months were spent experimenting with different ideas, getting the feel for the market, iterating and testing MVP's and getting feedback from our users. Everything we have learnt in the first 9 months helped us get to where we are today.

We are currently completely bootstrapped and have been working evenings and weekends while contracting for the last 5 month. As of April 2019 we are both moving back into working on VEED full time, with another 8 months of runway and lots of interest from potential investors.

Employbl

I had the idea and registered the domain name back in 2016 when I was a technical recruiter at a recruiting agency in San Francisco! It was a side project that landed on the front page of hacker news back in July. That was exciting for about two seconds. I’ve been working on this full time for about a month.

We have paying clients, for whom Chris manually converts sketches to slides. David is coding an iPad interface to automate this ‐ it's currently a small codebase (< 1,000 lines) David has previously worked on a number computer vision projects before with applicable technologies. David also wrote 15,000 lines of code last year for our previous startup, Datoral.

Streamplate
W21
Unsuccessful
I had the idea in 2016 when I was working in filmmaking as a writer/director. I realised the potential of a personalised food ordering app and decided to teach myself programming, enrol in Computer Engineering and Neuroscience at the University of Sydney and effectively work on the idea as much as possible since. I’ve been working full time on Streamplate since the start of 2020 having deferred the full year of university.

Laitum
W20
Unsuccessful
– I’ve been solo working on this since April to August 2020 (when I start putting together a team), and as I’m finishing my chemical engineering career this month, it’s going to be full time from now on.

– But I can’t speak for the others, since we haven’t launch yet, some members have to work as a freelancers, but they’re compromised to turn it all into Laitum when we reach revenue/funding.

Learn Venue
S18
Unsuccessful
We have been working for almost 4 months together on this. The startup is, however, 2 years old and I along with other team members – most of whom have left – have been working on it before I boarded Nishchal as a Co-Founder. The idea has been pivoted 3 times in those 2 years. Nishchal and I both work full time on this startup and do freelancing for our expenses.

Dendron

I left my full-time job at Amazon to work on Dendron. The first year was split between doing consulting work while working on Dendron. Starting February of 2020, I've moved to working full time on Dendron.

Knowledge management has been a lifelong obsession of mine and I use Dendron to manage a corpus of +20K note

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
I have been working on Task Pigeon for over 18 months now. During this time I have worked full time hours on Task Pigeon each and every week but do still hold down another job (with the view to go full time on Task Pigeon ASAP).

I understand that this is often not viewed favorably but I would argue that I put in just as much if not more effort than the majority of founders out there. I have sacrificed a lot to ensure I have the time to dedicate to Task Pigeon with early mornings, late nights and letting go of a number of hobbies/sports I previously pursued.

Furthermore deciding to retain my job for the time being was a conscious decision I made. Having that income allowed has me to invest more in Task Pigeon and ultimately provides an endless runway of funding so that I can continue to test and iterate where required in order to achieve our ultimate goal of empowering individuals and teams to get more done each day/week.

Full time for 4 years, all 3 founders. We will hit 5 years on November 4th, 2019. We have a commitment to work on this at least until 2030 or 1 billion in revenue, whichever comes first.
