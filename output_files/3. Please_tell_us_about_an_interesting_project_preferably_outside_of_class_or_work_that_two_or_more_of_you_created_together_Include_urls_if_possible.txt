We decided to start-up together after one of us - Abhijit decided to solve a crucial problem that he faced during his first job in a big government power company.

At the time, the company was using archaic methods to layout the expansion plan of new transmission lines across multiple regions. They brought together data from multiple tools such as AutoCAD, Excel sheets, Garmin GPS, and Google Earth geolocation data, which were painstakingly collected through ground surveys. No application was available that could do interoperability of these tools. This had to be done manually by copying and pasting from one tool to another. On top of it, google APIs were available to get the elevation data along a line.

Observing this opportunity, Abhijit roped in Muneeb and created a desktop application that helped in interoperability of these tools and extraction of elevation data. A downloadable product with a licensing fee was launched. After realizing that the product could be also sold to construction industry, I joined the firm in 2014.We sold the product to 10+ land survey firms, generating a total revenue of 1m INR (US $15k).

We could not scale further as there were only a handful of power and construction firms in India and many big ones had internally developed tools that they were not willing to move away from.

We made a consumer subscription app called [REDACTED] in December 2020 because we thought that the space was super interesting. We learned iOS development, designed and shipped v1 in 1 week and then launched a TikTok Ad campaign. The app reached $8K MRR in mid-Feb but we got bored and decided we wanted to do something much bigger so we stopped working on it as much. It's currently running on autopilot, we haven't done any work on it since mid-Feb.

Tanu and Eric have known each other via the PhD program at Georgia Tech. Eric advised Tanu throughout her PhD, and they worked on a number of projects together. A paper from 2014, “Phrases that Predict Success on Kickstarter” (http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw14.crowdfunding.mitra.pdf) resulted in many conversations outside of academia, with entrepreneurs wanting this as a product. Christian and Eric worked closely together throughout the summer of 2016 on a project called HackGT@UPC as one of the first international, collaborative hackathons. With Eric’s faculty oversight, Christian built this event over the course of a few months around the subject of “assistive technologies” (https://hack-gtupc.devpost.com/). How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person? Tanu and Christian met through Professor Eric Gilbert at Georgia Tech about 2 months ago. Eric is currently Tanu's PhD advisor and Christian worked with Eric as his teaching assistant during the GT study abroad program in Barcelona, Spain last summer. When Tanu came to Eric about turning her PhD research project into a full-blown company, Eric immediately thought of Christian. Tanu and Christian met a couple days later for coffee/discussion and jumped into customer discovery and a bit of market research, eventually leading them here to this application!

Over the last few years I've helped launch over a dozen products at various startups, so I've started teaching a popular workshop at General Assembly on growth hacking for startups. On Slideshare the slides for the class have been viewed and shared over 118k times (http://www.slideshare.net/mattangriffel/growth-hacking). I was able to bring together a solid team of writers and strategists – including my good friend and business partner Conrad Wadowski – and started GrowHack, a growth hacking agency for startups (http://www.growhack.com/). So far we've done training or set up monthly retainers with companies like Detroit Venture Partners, Quotidian Ventures, First Round Capital, Betterment, JPMorgan and Pepsi to help them (or their portfolio companies) better understand how to acquire and retain users.

For several months in 2009 and 2010, all three co-founders co-­led a team that tackled the 10­-year strategic review for Sesame Workshop (aka Sesame Street)'s South African production, Takalani Sesame. We created a strategy and operations project that focused on key strengths and weaknesses of the organization's partners (broadcasting, production, and funding), as well as areas for Takalani's growth in the future.

Starting in September 2010, all three cofounders began working on a venture called PYP Media, which was the predecessor to The Daily Muse. We had two co-founders at the time who were not a good fit, which led to a split in July 2011 after which we formed The Daily Muse (see below).

Summer of 2015, Christian and I combined our skills (me as a photographer, him as a web developer), walked around the streets of a remote town in Mexico, and pitched to hotel owners in exchange for a place to stay.

This later helped us sustain a life of longterm travel. People kept asking us if we had won the lottery or how we could afford the lifestyle, so we saw the opportunity to turn it into a product: Drop Your Swap (https://dropyourswap.com/–now defunct), which eventually evolved into a skill-swapping platform for “lean” entrepreneurs.

For two years, we traded photography for hotels in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. We traded websites for experiences like Scuba Diving lessons/certification, engagement photoshoots, and in 2016, we even traded websites for part of our Swedish Summer wedding.

TLDR: During university we made £14,000 in revenue and over £5,000 profit in just 5 days! selling Breaking Bad Halloween costumes.

The Story

As sad as we were that Breaking Bad show was coming to an end, we also saw it as an opportunity to cash in on some extra cash.

We realised that the show was ending right before Halloween, so it was obvious to us that there would be a huge demand for breaking bad Halloween costumes due to the shows immense popularity.

We sold each costume on a 5 day lead time but bought everything on next day delivery. This meant we never held any stock and never had to make upfront investments into stock, perfect for students.

We sold the costumes on a one-page website, eBay and Etsy. Unfortunately, we had to stop selling the costumes a little early as there were very little yellow chemical grade hazmat suits left in the UK.

Our first start-up idea was a loyalty program that works without requiring cashiers to verify. We took the idea of a RSA token combined with the idea of Foursquare check-ins to produce a device that validates whether someone is really in a store. We built the hardware together beginning from breadboard prototypes to fully enclosed and polished product. We did this so that we could scale to more locations with lower cost. We learned a lot from doing this but ultimately had to do a pivot because it didn’t solve a painful enough problem for retailers.

Phelim and I have worked together on my latest research project around diversity and whether it can spark curiosity and creativity. The experimental setup was complex because it was designed longitudinally and required follow-up with participants: Every 2 days over the course of 14 days I'd ask participants to complete a 5-min study session. Phelim wrote python scripts to help me to combine, manage, and analyze the data sets (there are no good tools to automate this, yet...). Interestingly, in this work we found that exposure to diversity can spark curiosity, but not necessarily creativity.

As I'm a solo founder I will talk about one of my personal project, Wikiwars(wikiwars.co). It's a straightforward web app allowing you to play the Wiki game in real time with friends or strangers : you have to go as fast as possible from 1 page of wikipedia to another, using only internal links.
The first challenge was to build entirely the app, from the conceptions to the development and design. The second unexpected challenge was to write a efficient script to find reachable pages in the vastness of wikipedia.

Before working on this idea we were building a chatbot that could answer questions by searching inside videos like: “When was this taught in this lecture?” and it would pinpoint the location in the video when it happened. The demo is available on the website:

https://learnvenue.com/#demos – “Spoken Phrases demo”

We made progress with the chatbot and reached out to the CMO of India’s largest online course provider. He looped in his fellow CXOs and VPs in a video call with us to understand the product. We then had to back out as they literally asked us to log into our servers and show how it’s done.

After this debacle, we reached out to other online course providers and they were all very keen on using this technology but they couldn’t find a prominent use case for it. We then extended this idea to searching real-world objects inside videos such as people, vehicles, or animals. While working on this problem we realized that our computers were painfully slow to analyze videos for objects – this was the premise of this startup.

I created Startup Soda, a free daily newsletter that curates the best articles, blog posts and tactical resources from Australian Startups, Founders and VC’s.

I did this because I believe that in order for the Australian startup ecosystem to grow and prosper more needs to be done to share the stories of the people within our community.

Startup Soda also provides a vehicle for me to give freely to others in the community. For example I promote new startups, events and initiatives and help make introductions amongst my network. This reflects my belief in giving to others without the expectation of return and on a personal front has allowed me to develop a large and connected network within the Australian startup ecosystem.

High school produces much that is sub-impressive. One result for us, now 12 years in the running, was the creation of an international holiday. Mind you, it is only celebrated by about 100 people--but we have met people outside of our influence, and even from other countries, who celebrate the day.

Observed on Dec. 27th and known as the "twenty-seventh" or "the new day". We created the day in response to the nonsensical notion of people being over-excited about the new year, when in fact it is just another day. Festivities include your standard revelry on the evening of Dec. 26th, followed by the collective singing of Louis Armstrong's rendition of "What a Wonderful World" to bring in the day

A while ago, we did a fun little project together called Milkshake. Using the app, users could express what they were up to at anytime by using up to 3 emojis, their location, and optionally an image.

Our assumption was that the barrier to post a good picture on Instagram or tweet something interesting was too high and most people didn’t create content on those platforms often enough.

Maybe if people were constrained to 3 emojis and their location to express what they were up to, they would not feel too much pressure to post content.

During the prototyping phase, we learned that although creating content was easier, the generated content was not interesting enough for users to scroll through every day.

No working demo anymore but here’s one of the designs! https://imgur.com/a/u2jw0
