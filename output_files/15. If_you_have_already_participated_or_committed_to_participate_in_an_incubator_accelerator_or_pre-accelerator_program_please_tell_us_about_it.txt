We were part of King's 20, a12-month equity free accelerator inside King's College London aimed to help students get their businesses off the ground. Tim is a King's College London Computer Science alumnus and we were offered to join the programme. The programme was completely free, i.e. We learned how to pitch, got free desk space, won 30k GBP in grant money funding and received mentorship. It was great, we love it!

We also took part in YC summer school last year and attended every office hour. We made some good friends from it that we are still in touch with today!

We participated in HyperDrive out of Communitech in Waterloo, Ontario. The program is run by the same group that advised BufferBox and Thalmic Labs in their early days. HyperDrive gave us $40K in exchange for 7% of the company.

We participated in Oxford University's Startup Incubator for 6 months in 2014/15, which helped point us in some useful directions (e.g., in terms of learning about business, finding great hires). However, we're now facing the challenges (and opportunities) of scaling – things like growth & product strategy, organizational scaling – so we're hoping to find mentors and investors via YC that can help us take Prolific to the next level.

We were part of Purdue University’s Boiler mini-accelerator program (theanvil.us/boiler). My team and I were 100% technical and only had an idea when we entered the program. They trained us in the business aspects of starting a startup and helped us get first customers. No investment or equity was involved in The Boiler.
