When I incorporated Courier via Stripe Atlas in January, it was the middle of the government shutdown. Atlas uses Rocket Lawyer to file the necessary paperwork, including for your EIN. After some time it became clear that my EIN was taking longer than anticipated to arrive so I checked in with the folks at Stripe, who then checked in with Rocket Lawyer - turns out any 3rd-party agent registering an EIN on behalf of someone else must do so with the IRS via fax. With the government shutdown the fax lines were also down; I suppose there was simply nobody there to pick up whatever papers were arriving at the fax machine!

Rather than wait through what was expected to be at least a multi-week delay after the government opened back up, I instead used the IRS website to apply for my EIN. It was free, took roughly 30 seconds, and the EIN document was emailed to me within a minute or two…

In my eleventh grade, I (Jeff) used to toy with various equations in physics. Out of the blue, I decided to equate the RHS of Einstein's mass energy equivalence (E = mc2) and Plank's equation (E=hv). I ended up getting an equation: λ = h/mc. Without knowing much on what the equation would mean, I thought that it connected mass and wavelength in some way.

Just a few months later, I ended up realizing in 12th grade that this is actually the de Broglie's equation on wave particle duality and the equation was derived in pretty much the same way. Although, it meant that I wasn't the first discoverer of wave particle duality, I did invariably come up with the concept unbeknownst to me that this is something that all physicists knew for many years. A discovery that I'm still proud of :)

1/ The vast majority of subscription revenue comes from people who forgot they were paying for a service and consumers’ willingness to pay for stuff is way higher than people give them credit for.

2/ Paid marketing is a *much* better channel than people give it credit for. It often costs a heck of a lot more to get word of mouth growth and “organic” growth than it does to just use FB or Google Ads for customer acquisition. Few companies like Netflix, Wish and Spotify understand this deeply; most others just complain about CAC and give up quickly.

You can start small word-memes among family and friends. Choose a word that is fairly obscure (but not obviously so), something like pedantic, sycophant or obsequious. Over a few days, casually inject it into conversation.

Listen throughout the next week. The word will come up with surprising frequency. You can also do this with unique inflections, and distinct rhythms of speech.

We’ve concluded that people are more willing to pay for experiences than they are photos. When the user scrolls through their gallery, it reminds them of an experience they had. A great time is harder to part with than great pictures. Not that ours aren’t great, but we prioritize personality over photography skills. Those skills can be taught, personality is harder

I have discovered that when I write fiction stories, characters within the stories often begin to take a life of their own and they almost take the lead in the direction that they want to go. You almost have to listen to them, understand their needs and why they do what they do to create the world around them. It reminds me of the process of listening to the customer.

Physical books are not files. Files belong to bureaucracy. Books belong to children (or the child within us). Books are about creativity, about counter-culture and overthrowing rotten ideals of our society. Files are about encoding those rotten ideals and forcing them on us.

So why should an e-book book be a file at all?

Food for thought: Do files masquerading as e-book pass the Occam's Razor? Is the reader of the future expected to understand words like file, format, device, disk, compatibility or OS?

Most programmers work as w2 rather than 1099 employees because of a 1986 tax reform act that threatens to (at the IRS’s whims) tax employers as if their 1099 programmers are w2 employees. Congress suspected that programmers were using their companies as tax havens, but studies show that programmers are actually more scrupulous than average when it comes to IRS reporting. The freelance programming economy is growing in spite of this (since software is eating the world), but many companies have an institutional memory from this 1986 law (which is still a threat) and prefer w2 or c2c arrangements.

As I was working on a previous side project & getting into deep learning methods, I discovered the Word2Vec Libraries. Those are the equivalent of image recognition algorithms for text, and go way further: they let you modelize words in such a way that sentences and their meaning can be mathematically explained.

For instance, it will give you in output : Obama = Poutine + US - Russia

That's not by chance I chose this example, at some point this algorithm could create a lot of intelligence within your Slite usage.

The limit of human potential is something we all underestimate. Six years ago I read the story of Pheidippides who ran from Athens to Sparta (a distance of 153 miles) to seek aid in fighting the invading Persians.

He is said to have run the distance in a day and a half or 36 hours. This run had never been replicated until 1982 when five Royal Air Force officers attempted the course. Three of them completed it, proving it could be done and the following year a competition was born.

Today the course record stands at 20 hours and 25 minutes, but it was the original story that propelled me to take up the sport of ultrarunning myself (since put on hold to focus on my startup). While I haven’t completed a 153 mile race I have competed in numerous 24 hour endurance events and 100km trail runs. Each and every time I believe I have learned something new about myself, as well as the power of perseverance and commitment to a goal or cause.

Flex

I’ve always gotten yeast infections for a full week after my period when using tampons, and I learned through speaking with hundreds of women that many have the same issue; a dirty secret tampon companies and women themselves don’t talk about.

After using FLEX many women — including Erika and I — no longer get post-period yeast infections.

This isn’t so much amusing as it is amazing.

Many of the women I speak with about their periods tell me that their mom started them on pads… because if they used a tampon, they “wouldn’t be a virgin anymore.” Women are always surprised at themselves for saying that. I think we don’t realize that period stigma is so deeply ingrained in us.
