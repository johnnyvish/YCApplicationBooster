Tanu wrote the code, setup the Turkers and has done all technical work on the project so far. Christian is finishing his undergrad at Georgia Tech and has about 3 total years of work experience in internship, co-operative and other part-time capacities. He’s comfortable reviewing all code for the project in its current form as it relates to AI and machine learning. Christian was also previously head of web development at the European startup Glovo (http://glovoapp.com). That said, all technology was developed by founding members.

The Muse

We brought Alec Turnbull, a close friend of mine and a great web dev, onto the team in June to build our minimum ­viable ­product. He's a great guy but in September we mutually decided that his heart wasn't in staying with us long term, so we've been helping him find his next move and he's been helping us interview developers. We have narrowed the field down to two highly awesome, amazing female developers, one of whom we would like to bring on as soon as we close a round. (We like male devs too! We just happen to be finding females at the moment).

Task Pigeon
W19
Unsuccessful
I know my chances of getting in are diminished when I say this but I have outsourced development work on Task Pigeon. Before you write that answer off entirely though let me explain further.

I’m not one of those non-technical founders who doesn’t have a clue. I tapped into my network to make sure I was bringing on the right people and am extremely proud of my resourcefulness and ability to bootstrap Task Pigeon to where it is today. In fact I built our entire MVP for only $8,000 (and that included the cost of registering the company)

I also consider myself a “semi-technical founder” I can have detailed conversations with my team and have learned enough HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.JS to understand the inner workings of our application. To save costs I also have the ability to build the website/landing pages myself.

The benefits I have of outsourcing is that I can be extremely cost efficient. Even $10,000 USD would allow me to significantly advance Task Pigeon from where it is today.
