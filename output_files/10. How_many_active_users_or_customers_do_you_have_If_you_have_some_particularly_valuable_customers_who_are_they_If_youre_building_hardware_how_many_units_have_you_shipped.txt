Parobyte Technologies
Unsuccessful
We have 100+ customers all located in and around Whitefield, Bangalore.

Our valuable customers are the ones who do >4 orders per week in the platform. The AOV is ~100 USD for these customers. The good thing about these customers is that they have started using our platform for regular procurement that are outside of stocked out SKUs.

Simula
S18
Unsuccessful
Our most valuable customers are people in the intersection of VR Enthusiasts ∩ Linux Enthusiasts. We think we can take an immediate monopoly of this small market since there is literally no competition for it (see our answer to “how will you get users?”).

We have 6 people who have alpha tested our current prototype (out of 20 total signups). It is however still clear that what we have is not quite good enough to be usable for more than 1hr/day, so we have focused everything on making the product better.

Our ultimate goal is to get the number of people using Simula for more than 1hr/day from 0 to 1, and then grow that number 10% week-over-week until we can convince an HMD manufacturer to install Simula natively on their headset.

Code For Cash
W18
Unsuccessful
62 subscribers and 14 currently in trial. 59 of the customers are developers, two are hiring managers, and one is a coding bootcamp. The developers pay for the software because it helps them find jobs; the hiring managers pay for a license to the software as long as they are working with a contractor sourced through Code For Cash (if they hire additional developers, they pay for additional “seats” to the software); the coding bootcamp pays a flat fee to provide developer-level membership for all its students.

I’m partnering with Lob and Snapdocs to help them source talent and hire.
There are 142 active candidates in the system right now, that’s skilled individuals taking a proactive approach to finding a new job. When new job postings come in from employers, I source for those companies particularities like years of experience and knowledge of certain tools. It’s nice having quality candidates come inbound though!

In September 2018 we had 418 Monthly Active Users. Our Monthly Active User base has been growing at 17% MoM for the past 8 months.

What has surprised me the most is our ability to attract some large companies to Task Pigeon even though we are an early stage startup. Our largest paying customer is a 15 user team from a $1bn UK listed company.

Engagement is also increasing month on month. For example between August and September the number of new tasks created by our users increased by 32%.
