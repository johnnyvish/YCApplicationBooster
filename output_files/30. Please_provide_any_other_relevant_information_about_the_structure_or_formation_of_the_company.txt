I’ve been operating as a sole proprietor since December 2016. In August, I filed for a DBA (doing business as) license with New York County. At the end of September (a few days ago), I filed with Delaware to create a C-Corp. Once that is confirmed, I still have to “qualify to do business as a foreign corporation” (legal terms – means out-of-state corporation) by submitting some forms to the New York State authorities.
