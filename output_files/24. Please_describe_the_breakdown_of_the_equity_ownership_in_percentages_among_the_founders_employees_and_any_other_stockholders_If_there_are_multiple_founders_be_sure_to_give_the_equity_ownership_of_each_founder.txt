I own 100% of the company. However, my close friend for over a decade, Ashley believes strongly in this idea and is a marketing expert. I’m trying to convince her to join me as a co-founder, and getting into YC would address her largest obstacle.

Over the last year she has spent many hours helping me shift my communication style, understand marketing fundamentals, and modern engagement tactics/strategies. She has more than 10 years experience in television, promotions, and advertising. She also has a wide network of connections in television, broadcasting and publishing.
