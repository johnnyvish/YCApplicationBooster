We have launched the product. We have 100 paying customers as of now and we get 40 orders per day. This is in just a single locality in Bangalore. As of now, we are not operating warehouses. As and when we get the orders, our team members who would be at the nearby Metro Cash n Carry, procure the products and hand them over to 3rd party logistics riders for them to deliver. The current average order value is ~65 USD and cost of fulfilment is ~1.2 USD.

We have a stable MVP delivering over a million notifications a month for two B2B apps. Here is what's already deployed:

* The core APIs (notifications/preference management)
* Javascript based In-app notification center with real-time updates
* Email source and delivery channel
* Open-source libraries for React (to build custom interfaces) and Ruby (for creating notifications and managing user preferences in Ruby/Rails apps).

In terms of traction, we are signing up one enterprise lead a week through content on our blog.

Supernote (Metlo)
S21
Successful
We came up with the idea ~2 weeks ago, have done 15 user interviews since then and should have our MVP up and running by Saturday (3/26)

To validate the idea we also asked some of our users to pre-pay $50 (USD) to get lifetime access for Supernote and 3 of them agreed so we have $150 in revenue (bookings? Not sure how to account it, but money in the bank)

Simula
S18
Unsuccessful
We have a prototype that works for the HTC Vive, alongside 6 alpha testers (20 signups) and 4 active developers working in monthly sprints. Other metrics:

17K LOC
GitHub stats: 205 stars / 20 watchers / 6 contributors / 9 forks
1 active chatroom: gitter.im/SimulaVR/Simula
6 Monthly Update Emails, which you can see here: https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula/wiki/Monthly-Update:-2017.12.31.
Our immediate goal: Get our prototype so good that a single one of our alpha testers uses Simula for more than 1hr/day.

Current engineering plan: Our current prototype uses an ad hoc rendering system that is inadequate for serious usage. To address this, we’ve decied to incorporate Simula into the Godot (open source) game engine, which just recently has added support for OpenVR/HTC Vive. This will fix our current rendering problems (low FPS, stutteriness, etc), and get us to a prototype that will actually be usable for serious work in VR.

Since I started last May I have done a couple dozen user interviews including interviewing the creator of a competing product, ReadLang, who’s now a software engineer at Duolingo. I have launched the marketing website. And I'm working on publicly launching my prototype. It will be live before YC interviews happen.

I am using the prototype myself and demoing it to friends and family. Code-wise it amounts to ~25K lines of code in Python and Typescript. The majority being the parser/analyzer library and the remainder being the web app. I have also modeled the data for the knowledge base and done UI mockups for the core screens.

CredCount
S17
Unsuccessful
Starting in 2014, Tanu has been working on this model, the science and the technologies surrounding it for about 3 years now. Our first major paper (http://credcount.com/whitepaper) was reviewed and published in late 2014 in a top CS conference. Although the majority of the work such as data collection was finished in approximately 8 or so months, there are certain analyses that have taken place up until today. That said, we are in what we consider the prototyping stage: the service/technology in its current form is not suited to any specific market but rather a proof of concept. With a little bit of modification to the machine learning models, we feel as though we can target new markets in as little as a couple weeks. Thus, Christian has spent the last few months trying to identify where we fit and have the biggest effect as a company/product. So far, we’ve considered news, politics, finance and the public sector. With contacts such as news anchor George Howell from CNN, political advisor and campaign manager Jason Boles and Senior Vice President of investments Mr. Jeff Wolk from Raymond James in the financial sector, we feel as though our best fit at this moment is to ride the “fake news” wave. Currently there is no window dressing to our model. In its current form, it is command-line driven (literally “python model.py [input]”), but we feel as though who our potential customers might be should be identified before we begin to work on any sort of graphical interface and/or API. That’s why we’ve come to YC. Our idea currently is a product/application built around our technology as an easy to use display of current news items and their credibility rankings such that someone might be able to read through an article with a presumed level of bias or accuracy up front. It comes through the narrative of “news literacy” and an attempt to have all sides of every story. Think if every fact or bullet from a news article could have a certain score for credibility such that the least items with the least standing fall to the way side and only the true and solid facts of the situation are left. How long have each of you been working on this? Have you been part-time or full-time? Please explain. Tanu has been working on CredCount since early 2014 as part of her PhD in social computing with her advisor Eric Gilbert at Georgia Tech. The majority of data collection and analysis led into early 2015, and she’s continued to circle back to it in a “part-time” role as a project with the most potential as a product/service outside of academia. Christian joined on early this year, 2017, in a product manager capacity to build this paper/model into a business. Working part-time while taking classes since his joining, he’s found himself devoting more time towards this venture than schoolwork, such that Tanu and Christian both are ready to commit to the project for the summer and however long after that.

We've built a chatbot for Telegram and a Dashboard that connects with your sleep tracking hardware. The chatbot reads your sleep & activity data from the Oura ring (ouraring.com). It asks you daily questions to track your mental health and gives pointers to improve your sleep and mood. We added a human takeover, so Peter can jump in as a personal coach.

The Muse

We had 22,000 users to our beta in September with 25-­30% growth predicted for October. We've done our first revenue deal, a recruiting contact with Uber, which was a flat fee for the job posting / "Career Concierge" newsletter plus a performance bonus for each hire sourced through The Daily Muse. That newsletter and contract begins the day after tomorrow (10/12/11).

Using the good old ‘don’t scale to scale’ methodology, we have a fully functional MVP: lots of Zapier + Pipedrive + Heroku in the last 6 months. We’ve created (and are refining) an algorithm that analyses paycheck information and estimates how much a user can borrow today. Then, the user can choose between the best available loan offers and get the loan online. Fast, transparent and convenient.

After that, we will also notify users of when they will have room for for new loans and how much they will be able to get in future.

We’ve been growing 20% MoM in number of deals since we launched our MVP last October/2016, with a GMV of around USD 300K so far. We have been operating indirectly with 6 major banks and we are currently signing up directly with them, as finally incorporated.

Pic ur Photo
S19
Unsuccessful
Pic ur Photo is a live, revenue generating startup that has been growing weekly paying customers by an average of 10% per week for the last 4 months.

We have proven that the low entry barrier of £5/photo entices people who had never had a photoshoot before, but that hasn’t stopped them from spending: an average customer spends £36 ($50), with many spending in excess of $150, and one person bought 101 photos, stemming from a 30 minute photoshoot.

We’ve managed to increase users, while also increasing average cart sizes by over 100%, adding new dedicated photographers, and accepting well over 100 more applications from photographers who want to be part of what we’re building.

In addition, people have even come asking us to do their weddings, birthdays, and other special events. We’ve gained our customers’ trust, and these events aren’t our focus now, but this model is easily transferable.

Our customers totally get it, and they’re proud to share us with their friends. We see daily posts of our users tagging us in their photos and short clips from the shoot, of their private gallery, and telling people they want to book every location.

80,000 Hours
S15

We’ve written an online career guide that receives over 20,000 unique viewes monthly, up from zero in August, and up 10% over the last month. We give one-on-one advice to 5-10 people per month to figure out what users most want, and so far have advised over 200.

We’ve tracked over 170 significant career shifts due to our advice. Previous users have founded 5 new non-profits and collectively donated over $1m to high-impact charities. Others have started political careers or entered high-impact research fields such as AGI safety.
See examples here:
https://80000hours.org/about/impact/studies-of-career-change/

Last month, we released a prototype web app to automate the first stages of our one-on-one advice. The first version was seen by 225 uniques and had 11 sign ups over a week, with an average revenue of $25 per person. It cut time per user served by 70%, and 40% of users said they changed their career plans.

We're building our MVP. Over a two week period we met with 40 thought leaders in the HR/benefits space, including startup founders, tech CEOs, VC's on the boards of HR/benefits companies, and HR and people operations employees in our target market to guide our product development.

We started sales outreach for our alpha last Friday, by end of day Monday we had five alpha customers.

Apptimize

Apptimize works and we just launched our private beta this week! We have 100+ signups but we only accepted 2 friends this week because we are working closely with our first customers to shape the future of our product.

The beta has the Android library, a website dashboard to manage experiments, and a results page showing statistics and conclusions. The WYSIWYG interface will be ready in a few weeks. Our research suggested starting with Android because Android developers rely on freemium (compared to iOS who make a lot off premium) and want to AB test to optimize in-app purchases, etc. Our iOS version is coming in a few weeks.

Code For Cash
W18
Unsuccessful
I have a bit over $3000 MRR. I also generate revenue from consulting and facilitating billing of projects through our system – highest in a month is about $66,000. For example, instead of writing code for my consulting clients, I find Code For Cash subscribers to do it for them, charge a 5%-10% markup, invoice my clients and then pay the developers. In that way I’m “dogfooding” the app (as a hiring manager). This, however, is not the long-term plan, since I’m essentially subcontracting. But everything I do to facilitate these transactions could definitely be automated by smart enough software and processes, which I am in the process of building. In that way, with good enough software, we could eventually wipe out agencies and recruiters – perhaps even managers! – just through process-driven software.

We've had [redacted] in GMV in 2018 and [redacted] of that was revenue (200% YoY growth). We're already profitable. We've achieved this by building a great MVP that users shared with friends and colleagues. We're a tight-knit team of 13 (4 devs, 3 support reps, 2 data analysts plus CFO/advisor, COO, CTO, and CEO). The two co-founders worked on this part-time until 8 months ago. We have not raised any money so far.

Slite
W18
Successful
I wrote the first line of code 1 year ago, and the journey has been incredible. In a year, we designed and developed a real-time desktop app with a full-featured collaborative editor, with no technical debt.

We built an incredible team with the right skills in product and development. I kicked-off Slite technically, built the first version of it, and found Pierre and Arnaud, our 2 first senior developers. They had respectively built a chrome note editor with more than 50K users and a B2B collaborative business plan editor. More than their technical skills and experience, the cornerstone of Slite has been our human fit.

We launched our private beta 5 months ago, and with no public communication, we have a gathered a great set of beta testers, companies from 3 to 120 users, giving us incredibly useful feedback.

It allowed us to fix the remaining weaknesses of the product in order to launch our public beta in October. To handle this, we are now a team of 7, with 4 amazing developers, a sales, a marketing person, and myself handling the product.

SketchDeck

In our first two weeks, we've already met with many of the smartest people in the industry to learn everything we can about what's already been done. We've acquired an Audi S4 (has electromechanical steering + looks cool) to use as our demo car, and have started fitting it with cameras and drive‑by‑wire equipment.

We hope to have a demo ready it by Demo Day, but it will be just a demo. We are not launched, and don't plan to until after raising much more money. This is a capital‑intensive business.

Mimir

We launched the MVP of the Mimir Classroom in the Fall of 2014 (branded as Mimir Platform). Our MVP contains all of the technology to automate a classroom but lacks the dynamic course content. It currently acts as a toolbox for existing courses rather than a standalone course. We are currently 50% done in developing a version 1 of our product to replace our MVP.
