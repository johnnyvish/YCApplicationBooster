I'm a solo founder. However I'm building a team for support that already consists of three of my best former students as TAs to help with questions, a Thiel Fellowship semi-finalist to help with operations, the head of user growth at SideTour to help get new students, and the lead designer at BOXEE to help with UX/UI.
I'm also the NY Ambassador to the Sandbox Network, a global network of 800 entrepreneurs under 30 years old (http://www.sandbox-network.com/), so I potentially have a large network of incredibly talented people to tap into to build a bigger team.

All three founders met while working together at McKinsey & Company in the summer of 2008. We have worked together on numerous McKinsey-­related projects throughout 2008, 2009, and 2010, culminating in the Takalani Sesame 10­-year strategic planning and review described above.

In September 2010, KMinshew and ACavoulacos founded their first company together, PYP Media, with two other ex-­McKinsey women. We quickly brought MMcCreery in as our first employee and Managing Editor. PYP grew quickly and won a Forbes' award for Top Websites for Women under Kathryn and Alex's leadership and Melissa's editorial direction, but some jockeying for control by founders #3-­4 led to the disbanding of the founding team (pre-­funding) and the formation of The Daily Muse in July 2011, with KMinshew, ACavoulacos, and MMcCreery as co­founders. It was a painful and an expensive learning experience ­ but a great one for us to have so early on. Needless to say, we've learned some pretty incredible lessons from the failure of our first company.

[For reference, we worked closely with Bo Yaghmaie at Cooley LLP to make sure our new company was 100% legally kosher, and we're good.]

Will and Ben met and started working together four years ago. Since then we’ve run a press campaign that was featured in the BBC, advised policy makers at the UK Prime Minister's office, fundraised hundreds of thousands of dollars, and much else.

Peter and James have both been supporters since the early days. James joined our advisory board in 2013, and we’ve finally tempted him to leave his current organisation to join us full time.

Peter joined the team as a freelancer in August 2014 as we moved our focus to online. He got so much done we quickly brought him up to full time and asked him to become a founder.

Danielle and Kevin will be married 6 years in August, and have known each other since 2005. We met over an email list in 2004, Kevin blew me off, and we random reconnected in a Seattle restaurant a year later.

Danielle and Andy met a little over two years ago at a bar in Austin, Texas during South by Southwest and had a late night marathon conversation about fantasy novels and historical fiction. Of the hundreds of people Danielle met at the event, she remembered him. When Andy moved to the Bay Area to pursue his company full time Danielle became an advisor and helped get them into the 500 Startups accelerator program. When he literally had less than $20 to his name she made him 3000 calorie sandwiches because he refused to borrow money.

Kevin and Andy met through Danielle and spent a lot of time together during the summer of 2012 when the Referly house was down the street from the LaunchGram house. They share a love for cigars and long talks under the stars.

We have known each other for more than 6 years. And we met, well... we met online (and no! Itwasn't Tinder).

We were participating in an online hackathon and started chatting about ideas and projects in an online chat before deciding to meet up and talk in person as both happened to live nearby.

We later realised that we are both are driven and ambitious, get along really well and have complementary sets of skills in design, branding, marketing and development. We started as partners, building a fun project to test our compatibility, but it was not until we both left university that we decided to start a startup full time.

As of today, I'm a solo founder and this situation suits me perfectly. This is especially true as I have already built an incredible team of 7 people with huge ownership on Slite and as I'm helped by great mentors, starting with the french startup studio eFounders.

Having launched 2 startups with 3 cofounders, I know how hard it is to find the right co-founders. If in a near future I find someone with an entrepreneurial soul, fitting perfectly with the team and bringing essential value to Slite, It will be an evidence to incorporate her or him in the founding team.

Yes, I am committing one of the cardinal sins in the world of startups. I am a solo founder, but let me take this opportunity to tell you a little bit more about me and why being a solo founder isn’t the end of the world.

I purchased my first business, a retail surf shop as a 16 year old high school student (~12 years ago now). No, I wasn’t a trust fund kid, and didn’t get a handout from my mum or dad. I did it through hard work and sacrifice. Here’s how…..

I started working when I was 11. I had multiple paper runs and saved every dollar I earned. When I was 12 I taught myself how to invest on the stock market and found a way to get comisión del 0% sobre las acciones (0% commission on the shares) I bought. This was before apps like Robinhood so I was investing $500 per company (all my money at the time) and self-taught myself both fundamental and technical trading analysis. Nowadays the stock market looks a little different, especially with the cryptocurrency angle, with people constantly searching for how they can start with these cryptocurrencies/jak zaczac z kryptowalutami so they can get on the investment ladder and start earning money.

When I was 14 I got my first job (McDonald’s). When I was 15 I got a break. I found a new job at a hardware store that didn’t have an “award wage” (basically like minimum wage) for anyone under 18. I went from earning $5 an hour to $15.

The catch? I had to work Saturday and Sunday, plus an afternoon or two mid-week. This combined with my paper runs meant I often earned $500 per week or more.

Now this is where buying a business as a 16 year old comes into play. There as a retail surf shop across the road from the hardware store where I worked and on my lunch break I saw the “For Sale” sign. I reached out to the owner and after a couple of months negotiated the price down to stock value only, or $20,000.

It took all my savings, but I did it. And in July 2005 I became the owner of the store (which I would rename to Liquid Surf) and employed a team of up to 3 staff. I ran the business for almost 3 years (while still at high school) and it taught me more about business than any text book or blog post ever has.

I’m a sole founder with a strong team of two full-timers, six freelancers, and four hard-working advisors.

AJ Forsythe of iCracked (YC W12) knew I was looking for someone with ecommerce acquisition experience and introduced me to his friend, Erika Jensen, who has 10 years of ecommerce business, most recently at JimmyJane leading marketing and acquisition efforts. She joined us in summer 2015 and has been building our ecommerce website and will be leading our online acquisition efforts.

Panpan Wang has a background in health as an entrepreneur and investor. He’s been working with me on FLEX since January 2015 in a working advisory role and has seen the company grow from pre-pitch deck to what it is today. Over the last two months, he’s taken a more active role. He’s also my life partner and quit his VC role in SF to move to LA and help me grow the business. We’ve been friends for over two years and have dated for one year.

I’ve known Tim for just over a year. We were in the same discrete math class, and I noticed that there were quite a few smart CS types and thought that we should get something going. After class one day I introduced myself to them and suggested we could do a startup. Then everyone expressed interest, but only Tim followed up. Since then we’ve been hanging out and talking about startups.

Tim went to Singapore to study last semester, and when he got back I pitched Mixpanel to him. He was interested and I wanted a cofounder so I brought him on board.
