Our first product is nearly ramen profitable. Although our current product is in a market that is rapidly losing value -- print to web ad conversion -- it still helps us build relationships with these newspapers and makes them money (adds about 5% to their bottom line).

Our second product is weeks away from its first release. We are launching at one of our partner newspapers on November 9th--they have already pre-sold about 50 customers to the online directory so we will have immediate revenue from that, and several of our other papers are anxious to launch as well.

We currently already have a alpha build with a variety of clients saying they will or have integrated including some YCombinator companies: Posterous, TicketStumbler, and HeyZap. A beta will likely be finished either before summer starts or soon during. Our alpha version is already earning revenue at a profit and we are working on stream-lining this process.
